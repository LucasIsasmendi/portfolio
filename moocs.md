Many seemingly great ideas and technologies come to a sudden halt in the face of one simple, inescapable question:

MIT has been asking its student entrepreneurs this question for many years – and with great success. The 25,600 companies started by MIT alumni generate $2 trillion in revenue and have created 3.3 million jobs. If MIT were a country, it would be the 11th largest economy in the world.
