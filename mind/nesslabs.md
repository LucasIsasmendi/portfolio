Shaping your mind frames to achieve your goals.
There are three main frames to consider to become a `master mindframer`:
- **Growth mindset**: The deep belief that growing happens through small, incremental steps, rather than big overnight victories. Compound gains. The resilience part is particularly important, trust the process and keep going.
- **Metacognition**: Your knowledge of what you know and donâ€™t know, as well as all the strategies you use for learning and problem-solving. `Thinking about thinking`. Use this awareness to enhance the way you learn and grow
- **Self-authorship**: The ability to define and express your own personal authority and to rely on your own internal voice to make decisions on a daily basis.

### A personal growth framework for makers
1. **Pact**: Commit to regularly spend time working towards your goal. Personal contract + plan for success
2. **Act**: repeatable + incremental actions
3. **React**: internalising the concepts. Produce + share content
4. **Impact**: create + launch something bigger

For each step, you will need a combination of a solid growth mindset, metacognition, and self-authorship.
Remember, self-authorship is key!
