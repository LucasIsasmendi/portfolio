# Framework

## Questions

- How does this help the __?
- Does this need its own token?

## Take into account

Analysis (Game Theory) <-> Synthesis (Mechanism Design) -> Optimization Design

### Optimization Design

- Goals: in the form of objectives (things to maximize or minimize) and constraints (things that must be met).
- Measurement & test: success against the goals
- System agents: do what it takes to get more token rewards
- System clock:  time dimension by which progress is made
- Incentives & Disincentives: In designing the system, we design what rewards or punishments to give, and how to give them.

### Token Methodology

- Formulate the Problem
- Try All Existing Patterns
- New Pattern?: Use building blocks **Token Design Patterns**

### Tools

- Simulator (research about this)
- Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Motivation: Extrinsic motivation works for some goals like “maximize security” or “maximize sharing of data”. But it can be dangerous in some places. Support intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic: filter out the bad actors with economic stake (TCR)

### Example Ocean Protocol

[source link](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/token-engineering-case-studies-b44267e68f4)

1. Define stakeholders/system agents, the value that provide and what they get in return
2. Write proper objectives and constraints (checklist).
3. Try plug-and-play patterns (solvers) against objectives and contrains
4. Update goals and back to step 2 until exhausted existing plug-and-play patterns
5. Design New Pattern
