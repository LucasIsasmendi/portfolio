1. Research before design

Build user personas to understand better how users will interact with your app

[A Comprehensive Guide to UX Research Methods.](https://theblog.adobe.com/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design-what-they-are-and-why-theyre-important/)

2. Prioritize features

Nothing is more confusing for first-time users than an app that has too much going on.
  - Focus on refining the experience around your core objectives

3. Cut out the clutter

“Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away.”
  - Strive for minimalism: Focus on the content that is valuable for your users and remove unnecessary elements that do not support user tasks.
  - Prioritize one primary action per screen: no more than one call-to-action.

4. Make navigation self-evident

  - Make sure that navigation feels familiar to users.
  - Design good information architecture

**Overall Principles**
1. Respect the platform
    - [apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/)
    - [android](https://material.io/design/)
2. Focus on the customer benefit: Do not design something simply because you can reuse a pattern or component for another feature. Always question yourself: How will this benefit the customer?
3. Think device first: Push your thinking beyond “mobile first.”  How can these device features be utilized in our products? How can the mobile device benefit users beyond the screen interface in front of them?
4. Keep scalability in mind. While the phone and tablet share many similarities, users use them very differently. A fundamental design principle for mobile phones is to include only necessary information. Do not overload the user with more than they need to know or take action on.

**Patterns and Guidelines**

- Screen Transitions
  - push: new screen that is stacked on top of the previous screen. Back button. Primarily for viewing, such as transaction detail screens or lists
  - modal: used when we are requiring the user to select, edit content, or input data. Cancel and Save/Done actions => push screen because you are viewing (not editing) the saved content. 

- Call to actions: use buttons with high contrast
- Empty States: provides a first impression to users who are new to our products. It usually consists of an illustration, a brief description, and a clear call to action. Perform a [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Carets: used to promote discoverability. Use carets when absolutely necessary.
- Action Sheets: Use action sheets whenever there are multiple actions associated with a single call to action
- Cards or Tiles: action card and info card.
