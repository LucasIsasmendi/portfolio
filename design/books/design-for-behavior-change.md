# Designing for Behavior Change
> Applying Psychology and Behavioral Economics

When student Mike Krieger turned in his first few projects, I saw his potential . He masterfully applied concepts learned in class to his designs . A few years later Mike drew from a class project called “Send the Sunshine” to create a global phenomenon called Instagram.
The success of Instagram wasn’t an accident. Mike had the skills to follow a winning formula: He tapped existing motivation, and he kept things simple. This is the same formula that students in my Facebook course used to engage over 24 million people with their class projects.
Many thousands of people can write code. But only a relative few can get the psychology right. And when it comes to behavior change, the right psychology makes all the difference.

> When well designed, a simple thing can have a big impact.
