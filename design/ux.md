**What is User Experience (UX)?**

“User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.” - Don Norman

A product’s success is based on how users perceive it:
- Does this product give me value?
- Is it easy to use?
- Is it pleasant to use?
