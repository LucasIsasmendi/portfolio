[4 Myths About Apple Design, From An Ex-Apple Designer](https://www.fastcompany.com/3030923/4-myths-about-apple-design-from-an-ex-apple-designer)

“I think the biggest misconception is this belief that the reason Apple products turn out to be designed better, and have a better user experience, or are sexier, or whatever . . . is that they have the best design team in the world, or the best process in the world,”

“It’s actually the engineering culture, and the way the organization is structured to appreciate and support design. Everybody there is thinking about UX and design, not just the designers. And that’s what makes everything about the product so much better . . . much more than any individual designer or design team.”

Google hires employees that think like Googlers, Apple hires employees that truly take design into consideration in all of their decisions.
It’s a coup, when you think about it, for marketers to be deep in the trenches with designers and engineers. (That level of collaboration is frankly unprecedented in the industry.)

Apple products are often defined by small details, especially those around interaction.
“It’s almost impossible to come up with really innovative things when you have a deadline and schedule.”
“It was more having a small team and knowing what people had worked on, and the culture of being comfortable sharing.”

- Holistic approach: It’s not just the interface piece. It’s designing the right business model into it. Designing the right marketing and the copy, and the way to distribute it. All of those pieces are critical.
