https://medium.theuxblog.com/a-product-design-toolkit-a-sprint-through-google-s-product-design-methodology-412b0743fadf

1. Understand
  - Vitamin v Painkiller
  - Research the market
  - Create a team
  - Customer research
  - Create personas
  - Create a key customer
  - Create a golden path
  - Interview experts
  - Create a Lean Canvas
  - Communicating the Lean Canvas
    - write your product idea into a Tweet 
    - write an executive summary: For the <>, who is dissatisfied with <>, our product is a <> that provides a <>. Unlike <>, we have assembled <>

2. Diverge
  - Analyse market: analyse the big players in more depth (SWOT)
  - Rough solutions: doodle as many solutions as possible (remember Golden Path)
  - Rapid variations: many ideas as possible, in a short amount of time
  - Solution sketches: vote ideas and come up with a few key solutions. These should then be mapped out in more detail in three stages

3. Decide
  - Narrow down ideas
  - Winners & maybe laters
  - Storyboarding

4. Prototype
  - Choosing the tool
  - Building: as a rule of thumb each prototype should take no more than a day to complete.
  - Trial run

5. Validate
  - Get five users
  - The interview
  - Two follow up survey questions
  - Summarising findings

6. Iterating
  - Key Metrics
  - A/B Testing
  - Start again?

## UX Process: What It Is, What It Looks Like and Why It’s Important
https://theblog.adobe.com/ux-process-what-it-is-what-it-looks-like-and-why-its-important/

1. Product Definition
  - Stakeholders interviews
  - Create value proposition
  - Concept sketching
  - Project kickoff meeting 
2. Product Research: market research
  - Individual in-depth interviews
  - Competitive research
3. Analysis
  - Create hypothetical personas
  - Create experience maps: user flow
4. Design: collaborative, Iterative
  - sketching: by hand
  - wireframes: page structure and visual hierarchy, skeleton for mockups
  - prototypes: simulation of the product, with clickable wireframes
  - design specification: user flow and task flow diagrams which outline the functionality and style requirements of the product.
5. Validation (testing)
  - Eat your own dogfood
  - User testing sessions: usability testing, focus groups, beta testing, A/B testing, and surveys.
  - Create user diaries
  - Metric analysis
  - Working with feedback from users

How To Improve UX Design Process
- Consider overlap between phases and iterations
- Communication is very important
- Processes morph to fit projects

1. Discovery — 2 days
  - 1.1 Business Interview
  - 1.2 User Interview & Card Sorting (output: Information Architecture)
  - 1.3 Comparable Analysis (output: competitors qualities)
2. Ideation — 2.5 days
  - 2.1 User Journey Mapping (output: user flow)
  - 2.2 Wireframing Session (co-creation session)
3. Creation & Delivery — 3.5 days
  - 3.1 — Sketch out the low-fi wireframes based on the outcome from wireframing session
  - 3.2 — Create three variations of high-fi UI and list the pros/cons for each option
  - 3.3 — Present to the stakeholders, recommend one option and get their feedback
  - 3.4 — Create secondary screens and an interactive prototype
  - 3.5 — Deliver to development team and work in parallel to create different states (e.g. blank, loading, partial, error states etc.) and edge cases.
