## The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout
The Law of...
1. **Leadership**: It’s better to be first than it is better.
2. **Category**: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in. You have no competition.
3. **The Mind**: It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. 
4. **Perception**: Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perception.
5. **Focus**: The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind.
6. **Exclusivity**: Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.
7. **The Ladder**: The strategy you use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder. The higher the better.
8. **Duality**: In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.
9. **Opposite**: If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.
10. **Diversion**: Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories. 
11. **Perspective**: Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time. 
12. **Line Extension**: There’s an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand.
13. **Sacrifice**: You have to give up something in order to get something.
14. **Attributes**: For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.
15. **Candor**: When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.
16. **Singularity**: In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.
17. **Predictability**: Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.
18. **Success**: Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure.
19. **Failure**: Failure is to be expected and accepted.  
20. **Hype**: A situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.
21. **Acceleration**: Successful programs are not built on fads, they’re built on trends.
