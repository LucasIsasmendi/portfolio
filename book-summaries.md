## The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout
The Law of...
1. **Leadership**: It’s better to be first than it is better.
2. **Category**: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in. You have no competition.
3. **The Mind**: It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. 
4. **Perception**: Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perception.
5. **Focus**: The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind.
6. **Exclusivity**: Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.
7. **The Ladder**: The strategy you use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder. The higher the better.
8. **Duality**: In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.
9. **Opposite**: If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.
10. **Diversion**: Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories. 
11. **Perspective**: Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time. 
12. **Line Extension**: There’s an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand.
13. **Sacrifice**: You have to give up something in order to get something.
14. **Attributes**: For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.
15. **Candor**: When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.
16. **Singularity**: In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.
17. **Predictability**: Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.
18. **Success**: Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure.
19. **Failure**: Failure is to be expected and accepted.  
20. **Hype**: A situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.
21. **Acceleration**: Successful programs are not built on fads, they’re built on trends. 
22. **Resources**: Without adequate funding, an idea won’t get off the ground.

[summary link](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/create-or-hate/)

## Decisive
### The Five Big Ideas
1. The four villains of decision making are (1) narrow framing, (2) confirmation bias, (3) short-term emotion, and (4) over-confidence.
2. Avoid “whether or not” decisions. Instead, consider several options simultaneously.
3. Ask yourself, “Who else is struggling with a similar problem, and what can I learn from them?”
4. When gathering good information and reality-testing your ideas, go talk to an expert.
5. Rather than choose “all” or “nothing,” chose “a little something.”

### Summary
we are quick to jump to conclusions because we give too much weight to the information that’s right in front of us while failing to consider the information that’s just offstage.
Narrow framing is see choices in binary terms.

The mnemonic `WRAP` captures the four actions needed to protect you from the four villains:
- Widen your optins.
- Reality-test your assumptions.
- Attain distance before deciding.
- Prepare to be wrong.

To escape narrow frames, be aware of “whether or not” decisions. Example: “You cannot choose any of the current options you’re considering. What else could you do?”

“Multitracking” involves considering several options simultaneously. 

We need to downplay short-term emotion in favor of long-term values and passions. To do a 10/10/10 analysis, think about a decision on three different time frames: How will you feel about it 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now?

When you put these two forces together—the mere-exposure(we like what’s familiar to us) principle and loss aversion(losses are more painful than gains are pleasant.)—what you get is a powerful bias for the way things work today.
In helping us to make a decision, the single most effective question may be: What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?

set a timer that goes off once every hour, and when it beeps, we should ask ourselves, “Am I doing what I most need to be doing right now?”

Core priorities are long-term emotional values, goals, aspirations.
By identifying and enshrining your core priorities, you make it easier to resolve present and future dilemmas. To carve out space to pursue our core priorities, we must go on the offense against lesser priorities.

> By bookending—anticipating and preparing for both adversity and success—we stack the deck in favor of our decisions.

The goal of a tripwire is to jolt us out of our unconscious routines (autopilot) and make us aware that we have a choice to make.
At some point, the virtue of being persistent turns into the vice of denying reality.

- If you can’t make it through the Dip, don’t start.
- Selling is about a transference of emotion, not a presentation of facts. 
- If you’re not able to get through the Dip in an exceptional way, you must quit. And quit right now.

### Summary
- If you don’t set a baseline standard for what you’ll accept in your life, you’ll find it’s easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that’s far below what you deserve
- Making a true decision means committing to achieving a result, and then cutting yourself off from any other possibility
- In order to succeed, you must have a long-term focus
- Make decisions often and learn from them
- Ask yourself, ‘What’s good about this? What can I learn from this?
- Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach
- Most of us base our decisions about what to do on what’s going to create pain or pleasure in the short term instead of the long term
- It’s not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean
- If you develop the absolute sense of certainty that powerful beliefs provide, then you can get yourself to accomplish virtually anything, including those things that other people are certain are impossible
- The way to expand our lives is to model the lives of those people who are already succeeding. 
- There are three specific beliefs about responsibility that a person must have if they’re going to create long-term change: Something must change, I must change it, I can change it
- So often we blame the wrong cause, and thereby close ourselves off from possible solutions
- A genuine quality of life comes from consistent, quality questions
- The words you habitually choose also affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience
- Simply by changing your habitual vocabulary—the words you consistently use to describe the emotions of your life—you can instantaneously change how you think, how you feel, and how you live
- Many people know what they want to have, but have no idea of who they want to be
- Anytime you have difficulty making an important decision, you can be sure that it’s the result of being unclear about your values
- If you ever feel angry or upset with someone, remember, it’s your rules that are upsetting you, not their behavior
- Design your rules so that you’re in control, so that the outside world is not what determines whether you feel good or bad. Set it up so that it’s incredibly easy for you to feel good, and incredibly hard to feel bad
- Limited references create a limited life. If you want to expand your life, you must expand your references by pursuing ideas and experiences that wouldn’t be a part of your life if you didn’t consciously seek them out
- As we develop new beliefs about who we are, our behavior will change to support the new identity
