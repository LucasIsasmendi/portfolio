English verbs come in different forms.

| go          | went        | gone            |

#### Past Participles Rules
- Past participle cannot be the only verb in a sentence.
  - Wrong: ~~I flown in an airplane~~
- When we use past participles, we need a helping verb like have or had.  
  - Right: I have flown in an airplane. (Present Perfect)
  - Right: I had flown in an airplane. (Past Perfect)

### Present Perfect with Since and For
connecting the past with the present using since and for
- **Since**: the specific time an event started: _My friend has studie English since 2012|last year|she was 8_
- **For**: the length of time since something started: _My friend has studie English for a month|two years_

### Present Perfect without Since and For
- unspecified time, start time is unsaid, focus on past experience (focus on what, instead of when): _I have lived in Germany_, _I've lived in Paris_, _I haven't lived in China_

- Wrong: ~~Judy has visited Thailand in 2014~~
- Right: Judy has visited Thailand many times

If we want to use a specified time in the past, not including now, we use the `past simple` (finished time, specific time). _Judy visited Thailand in 2014_

Example
- Past Simple : _I drank two glasses of lassi this morning._ (breakfast finished)
- Present Perfect: _I have drunk two glasses of lassi this morning._ (still is breakfast time)
