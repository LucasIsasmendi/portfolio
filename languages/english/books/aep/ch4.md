# AEP > Diphthongs
## 4. Diphthongs
A diphthong is two vowel sounds together.
The mouth position matters: what defines the diphthong is that there are two different sounds. This means there has to be a movement, going from a starting position to an ending position.

- [oʊ](#oʊ)
- [aʊ](#aʊ)
- [aɪ](#aɪ)
- [eɪ](#eɪ)
- [ɔɪ](#ɔɪ)
- [ju](#ju)  

### [a4.1 - Diphthongs](engl.io/aha)

### `oʊ`
- `jaw`: drops for the beginning position, relax up for the ending position
- `lips`: might round some for the beginning position, but round even more for the ending position
- `tongue`: shifts back a little bit at the beginning, and the back lifts in the ending position. The back is more lifted here than in the pure [ʊ] (‘push’ [pʊʃ]).

#### [v4.1 - OH as in NO [oʊ] Diphthong](engl.io/ahd)

If you don’t round their lips enough, this diphthong can sound like the AW as in LAW [ɔ] or AH as in FATHER [ɑ] vowel instead. Remember, it’s the movement of rounding the lips that defines this diphthong. Exaggerate it a little bit.
