# 5. Consonants
there is no stressed and unstressed versions, because the shape and length of a syllable generally comes from the vowel or diphthong sound, not the consonants.

One consonant can represent various sounds, and you have to learn the pronunciation of each word as you learn the word.

Consonants fall into two categories, 🔈`voiced` and 🔇`unvoiced`
- [b-p](#b-p)
- [g-k](#g-k)
- [t-d](#t-d)
- [v-f](#v-f)
- [z-s](#z-s)
- [sh-zh](#sh-zh)
- [th(θ-ð)](#thθ-ð)
- [ʧ-ʤ](#ʧ-ʤ)
- [m](#m)
- [ŋ](#ŋ)
- [n](#n)
- [h](#h)
- [y](#y)
- [w](#w)
- [ɹ](#ɹ)
- [l](#l)   

### [A5.1 - Paired Consonants](engl.io/ak4)
Paired Consonants (🔈`voiced` | 🔇`unvoiced`):
- 🔈 B[b] | 🔇 P[b]
- 🔈 G[g] | 🔇 K[k]
- 🔈 D[d] | 🔇 T[t]
- 🔈 V[v] | 🔇 F[f]
- 🔈 Z[z] | 🔇 S[s]
- 🔈 ZH[ʒ] | 🔇 SH[ʃ]
- 🔈 TH[ð] | 🔇 TH[θ]
- 🔈 J[dʒ] | 🔇 CH[tʃ]

### [A5.2 - Unpaired Consonants](engl.io/ak7)
The rest of the consonants are unpaired. That means they have a unique mouth position. 
- 🔇`unvoiced`: H[h]
- 🔈`voiced`: M[m], N[n], NG[ŋ], Y[j], W[w], R[ɹ], ligh L[l], dark L[l] (nasal), with the vocal cords buzzing with the sound.

**Section 1: Paired Consonants**

## `b-p`
Stop consonants: stop happens when the lips close
- `jaw`: drop a little
- `lips`: remain closed
- `tongue`: forward

### [v5.2 - B[b] and P[p] Consonants](engl.io/ak8)
- sample words: pad[pæd|], bad[bæd|], pot[pɑt|], bought[bɔt|]
- sample sentence: Pick a big print for the bedspread [pɪk~ə_bɪg|_pɹɪnt|_fəɹ_ðə_ˈbɛd|spɹɛd]

When the B or P is at the end of a sentence, the release will be dropped, or the release will be light

### [v5.3 - Stop Consonants](engl.io/aka)
The definition of a stop consonant has three parts
1. tongue or the lips close off the air flow entirely.
2. build up of pressure
3. release

There are 6 different stop consonants: 
- close by lips: [p-b]
- close by tongue: [t-d]
- close by tongue back: [k-g]

IPA rachel symbol for release in a stop consonant is not pronunced: `|`. Examples: stop[stɑp|], wait[weɪt|]

### [a5.3 - Listen + Repeat - B[b] and P[p]](engl.io/akd)
- ▶️: b[b], p[p], put[pʊt], boss[bɔs], shopping[ˈʃɑp-ɪŋ], subway[ˈsʌb-weɪ], stop[stɑp]
- ⏹️: job[ʤɑb│]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- b: bought [bɔt]
- bb: wobble [ˈwɑb əәl]
- p: put [pʊt]
- pp: happy [ˈhæp i]
- gh: hiccough [ˈhɪk ʌp] (this is an unusual spelling, it’s usually spelled ‘hiccup’)

## `g-k`
- `tongue`: lifting the back, touches the soft palate, then pulling down to release the tongue and the air. Tongue tip: do not affect this sound
- `jaw`: drop a little
- `lips`: do not affect this sound. They can take the shape of the next sound

The G[g] sound is `voiced` 🔈, and the K[k] sound is `unvoiced` 🔇.
These consonants are stop consonants. Sometimes you’ll hear a stop, and sometimes you’ll hear a light release.

### [v5.4 - G[g] and K[k] Consonants](engl.io/akf)
- Sample words: cap[kæp]/gap[gæp], curl[kɜɹl]/girl[gɜɹl], kill[kɪl]/gill[kɪl]
- Sample sentence: Chris carried the gray crate to the gate [kɹɪs_ˈkeɪɹ-id_ðə_gɹeɪ_kɹeɪt_tə_ðə_geɪt]

### [a5.4 - Listen + Repeat - G[g] and K[k]](engl.io/akh)
- ▶️: gg[g], kk[k], click[klɪk], dog[dɔg]
- ⏩: cut[kʌt], go[goʊ], location[loʊˈkeɪ-ʃəәn], ugly[ˈʌg-li]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. [g]
- g: go [goʊ]
- gg: wiggle [ˈwɪg əәl]
[k]
- c: can [kæn]
- cc: occur [əәˈkɜɹ]
- k: skip [skɪp]
- ck: tick [tɪk]
- ch: character [ˈkæɹ ɪk təәɹ]
- x: extra [ˈεk stɹəә]
- q: quite [kwaɪt]

## `t-d`
T is one of the hardest consonants because there is more than one pronunciation.
First, let me clarify that we’re talking about the sounds [t] and [d], not the letters T and D.

### [v5.5 - Contractversation](engl.io/akj)
- going to -> to[də]
- Do you -> [djə]
- want to -> wanna
- thank you -> thanks
- I have -> I've
- got to -> [gɑt|tu]
- get done -> [gɛt|dʌn]
- I will -> I'll[ɔl]
- I would -> I'd
- That will -> that'll[ˈðæd-əl]
- you -> [jə]

**Ways to pronounce [t]**
### (1) Stop T [t│] 
- When the next sound is a consonant: cutback [ˈkʌt│ˌbæk], put my [pʊt│_mɑɪ]
- At the end of a thought or sentence: I knew that. [ɑɪ_ˈnu_ðæt│]. Neat. [nit│]
- In the T-schwa-N sequence: important [ɪmˈpɔɹ-t│ənt│], mountain[ˈmaʊn-t│ən]

The Stop T is made when you stop the air and don’t release it before starting the next sound (skipping the release).
You leave your tongue tip down, middle tongue stop de air.
It changes the vocal shape of the word, end more abruptly. The melody shape isn’t as curved.

#### [a5.5 - Listen + Repeat - Stop T vs. No T](engl.io/akm)
Words without the stop T go down in pitch at the end. Words with the Stop T end more abruptly.
- way [weɪ] — wait [weɪt│]
- bay [beɪ] — bait [beɪt│]
- day [deɪ] — date [deɪt│]
- fee [fi] — feet [fit│]
- she [ʃi] — sheet [ʃit│]
- pow [paʊ]— pout [paʊt│]

### (2) Flap T [d]
- When the T comes between vowel sounds: pretty [ˈpɹɪd-i]
about it [əәˈbaʊd‿ɪt│]
- When the T comes after an R before a vowel sound: party [ˈpɑɹ-di], sort of [ˈsɔɹd‿əv]

It sounds like the R [ɾ] in Spanish (caro). Not the American R [ɹ].
The very front of tongue bounces against the roof of the mouth quickly. The air does not stop, the word flows

#### [v5.6 - The Flap T like in PARTY](engl.io/akp)
Flap T after R, before a vowel.
- example words: alerted[ə-ˈlɜɹ-dɪd], article[ˈɑɹ-dɪ-kəl], charter[ˈtʃɑɹ-dəɹ], mortified[ˈmɔɹ-də-ˌfaɪd], sorted[ˈsɔɹ-dɪd], vertical[ˈvɜɹ-dɪ-kəl]
- example phrases: part of[ˈpɑɹ‿dəv], expert in[ˈɛk-spɜɹ‿dɪn], airport on[ˈɛəɹ-pɔɹ‿dɑn]

#### [v5.7 - The Flap T like in PRETTY](engl.io/akr)
Flap T between vowels. Not starting a stressed syllable
- example words: pretty[ˈpɹɪd-i], city[ˈsɪd-i], matter[ˈmæd-əɹ]
- example phrases: thought of[θɔd‿əv], what is it[wʌd‿ɪz‿ɪt|],

### (3) No T at All
Drop the T sound between consonants, is not as strong of a habit for Americans as using the Flap and Stop T.
- Examples: exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li], kept my [kεp│_maɪ]
- After the N sound: internet[ˈɪn-əɹˌnεt│], wanted[ˈwɑn-ɪd]

#### [v5.8 - On the Farm](engl.io/akt)
- out: out[aʊt|], out of[aʊd‿əv], out[aʊt](depends of the situation)
- phrases: what is[wʌd‿ɪz], just said[dʒʌs‿sɛd], kind of ->'kinda'[ˈkaɪnd‿ə], out lately[aʊt|-ˈleɪt|-li], about to[ə-ˈbaʊt|-tə]
- drop T: exact[ɪɡˈzækt] -> exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li]
- true T: great[gɹeɪt]

#### [v5.9 - T and D between Consonants](engl.io/akv)
When the T and D sounds come between two other consonant sounds, many Americans will drop them.
- words: exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li], 
- links: grand piano, grand theft auto, just one[dʒʌs_wʌn](the one word is w consonant),just once, just for, must be, stand for

### (4) True T[t]
At the beginning of a stressed syllable. In consonant clusters.
The True T is a stop consonant: 
- `step 1`: stop the air in the throat, close your teeth, and bring the tip of the tongue to the roof of your mouth, behind your front teeth. 
- `step 2`: The release is a burst of air: lower your tongue, let your teeth part, and release the air, beginning the next sound

### [v5.10 - T and D Consonants](engl.io/akx)
- pat[pæt]
- Stop consonants are sometimes pronounced without the second part, without this release, when they come at the end of a syllable or a word. Example: I bet you did[aɪ_bɛt|‿jʊ_dɪd]
- when the T comes between two vowel sounds, it sounds like a d: madder[ˈmæd-əɹ] and matter[ˈmæd-əɹ]
- The lip position of these sounds is influenced by the sound that comes next: dime[daɪm], drain[dɹeɪn], do[du]
- example words: time[taɪm]/dime[daɪm], tad[tæd|]/dad[dæd|], tote[toʊt|]/dote[doʊt|]
- example sentence: Tom tasted Dad’s dark chocolate treats[tɑm_ˈteɪst-ɪd‿dædz_dɑɹk_ˈʧɑk-lət|‿tɹits]

Exceptions:
- into [ˈɪn-tu]: True T
- seventy [ˈsεv-әn-di] and ninety[ˈnaɪn-di]: Flap T’s
- politics [ˈpɑl-ә-tɪks]: True T

At eight[æd‿eɪt|]. An acquaintance told me[ən_ə-ˈkweɪnt|-əns_toʊld_mi]. I slept well last night[aɪ_slɛpt_wɛl‿læst_naɪt|]

### [a5.7 — What T do you Hear?](engl.io/ang)
5/8 (pagina 94 - respuesta 261)

### The D Sounds
- `tongue`: (1) stop the air in your throat and bring the tongue tip to the roof of the mouth. (2) Release the tongue with your voice—this is a voiced consonant—and go right into the next sound.
- `jaw`: teeth close or not

Stop T and a D that’s not released sound almost the same. With the D, however, there is a bit of a voiced sound in the throat, even in the stop.
Another tip: when two words are the same but one ending is voiced and the other unvoiced, the vowel before the voiced ending is just a little longer. So ‘hid’[hɪd│] is a little longer than ‘hit’[hɪt│], ‘buzz’ is a little bit longer than ‘bus’, and so on.

If the D comes between two vowels or diphthongs (“body”), or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong (“hardy”), the air doesn’t stop. These are the same rules for the Flap T, and it sounds just like the Flap T.
Because the Flap T and the D between vowel sounds the same, these words sound the same: 
- matter[ˈmæd-əɹ] — madder[ˈmæd-әɹ]
- writer[ˈɹaɪ-dәɹ] — rider[ˈɹaɪ-dәɹ]

### [v5.14 - Homophone Phrases](engl.io/anj)
A homophone is a pair or set of words that have different meanings and often different spellings, but sound the same, like flour/flower. The context will tell you which one is.
- [ˈgɑd-ə]: got a/got to/I’ve got to.
- [ˈlɛd-ər]: let her/lead her/letter. 
- [ˈbʌd-ər]: but her/butter
- [ˈgeɪv-əm]: gave him/gave them

### [a5.8 - Listen + Repeat - The D [d] Consonant](engl.io/anm)
- ▶️: dd[d], need[nid] ,add[æd]
- ⏩:do[du], die[daɪ], lady[ˈleɪ-di], medicine[ˈmεd-ә-sɪn]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- t: tap[tæp]
- tt: attain[әˈteɪn]
- d: dog[dɔg]
- dd: add[æd]

## `v-f`
These consonants are ‘fricatives’, which means we pass the air through a narrow channel made by the lips, tongue, or teeth.
In this case, we bring the bottom lip up to touch the bottom of the top front teeth and pass air through this pressed space. The F[🔇] is unvoiced, and the V[🔈] is voiced.
We don’t want it to curl in, just lift. It’s the inside of the bottom lip that should touch the bottom of the top front teeth.
The lips have to be loose, without tension, so they can vibrate with the air.
hold them out for several seconds as you practice, to fine-tune your mouth position.

### [v5.15 - V[v] and F[f] Consonants](engl.io/anp)
- Sample words 🔇[f]-🔈[v]: fan[fæn] - van[væn], fault[fɔlt] - vault[vɔlt], photo[ˈfoʊˌdoʊ] - vote[voʊt|]
- Sample sentence: They served a very fresh oven-baked flounder fillet [ðeɪ_sɜɹvd‿ə_ˈvɛ-ɹi_fɹɛʃ_ˈʌv-ən-beɪkt_ˈflaʊn-dəɹ_fɪ-ˈleɪ]

### [a5.9 - Listen + Repeat - V[v] and F[f] Consonants](engl.io/ans)
vv[v], ff[f], fail[feɪl], vest[vεst], delivery[dɪˈlɪv-ә-ɹi], differ [ˈdɪf əәɹ], leave[liv], leaf[lif]
- The [v] at the end of ‘leave’ is weak. Not like the [v] in ‘vest’
- ‘Leaf’ is a little shorter.

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- f: fun[fʌn]
- ff: stuff[stʌf]
- ph: phone[foʊn]
- gh: laugh[læf]
- v: love[lʌv]
- vv: savvy[ˈsæv-i]

## `z-s`
These sounds are also fricatives. Here, the air passage is made narrow with the teeth. The `teeth` come together, and the `tongue` can take one of two positions. It can either point down, so it presses against the back of the bottom front teeth (that’s how I make it). Or, it can point up, where the tongue tip doesn’t touch anything, but is close to the roof of the mouth. The S is unvoiced(🔇) and the Z is voiced(🔈).

### [v5.16 - S[s] and Z[z] Consonants](engl.io/anu)
- Sample words 🔇[s]-🔈[z]: sip[sɪp]-zip[zɪp], see[si]-zebra[ˈzi-brə], bus[bʌs]-buzz[bʌz]
- Sample sentence: Because it’s sunny and he’s fair-skinned, he has to wear sunscreen [bɪ-kʌz_ɪts‿ˈsʌn-i_ænd_hiz_fɛəɹ-skɪnd], [hi_hæs_tə_wɛəɹ_ˈsʌn-skɹin]

### [a5.10 - Listen + Repeat - Z[z] and S[s] Consonants](engl.io/anw)
- zz[z], ss[s], sun[sʌn], zoo[zu], dressy[ˈdɹεs-i], Brazil [bɹәˈzɪl], lays[leɪz], lace[leɪs]

Spanish speakers, make a very clear S[s] sound for every S they see. But many S’s are pronounced as a Z: busy[ˈbɪz.i], business[ˈbɪz.nɪs], husband[ˈhʌz.bənd], cousin[ˈkʌz.ən], as[əz], these[ðiːz], president[ˈprɛzəˌdɛnt], always[ˈɔlˌweɪz]. You just need to learn the pronunciation of them as you learn the word.

### [v5.17 - Letter S as the [z] Sound](engl.io/anz)
- 🔈[z]: cousin[ˈkʌz.ən], husband[ˈhʌz.bənd], because[bɪˈkɔz], bruise[bruz], is[ɪz], his[hɪz], was[wʌz], design[dɪˈzaɪn], lose[luz]
- (as a verb): use[juz]/ house[haʊz]
- (as a noun): use[jus] / house[haʊs]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- [s]
- s: sun [sʌn]
- ss: mess [mεs]
- x: extra [ˈεk stɹəә]
- cc: accept [ækˈsεpt]
- c: cell [sεl]
- sc: scent [sεnt]
- [z]
- z: zoo [zu]
- zz: buzz [bʌz]
- s: busy [ˈbɪz i]
- ss: dessert [dɪˈzɜɹt]

## `sh-zh`
These sounds are also fricatives. 
- `teeth`: come together for these sounds to constrict the air passage.
- `tongue`: tip lifts so the tip and the front part of the tongue are very close to the front part of the roof of the mouth, but not touching.
- `lips`: flare out.

SH[ʃ]is unvoiced(🔇) and ZH[ʒ] is voiced(🔈).

### [v5.18 - SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ] Consonants](engl.io/an2)
- sample words: ship[ʃɪp], measure[ˈmɛʒ-əɹ] / dish[dɪʃ], decision[dɪ-ˈsɪʒ-ən] / wash[wɑʃ], mirage[mɪ-ˈɹɑʒ]
- Sample sentence: She made the decision to get a beige bed spread with chic striped sheets. [ʃi_meɪd|‿ðə_dɪ-ˈsɪʒ-ən_tə_gɛd‿ə_beɪʒ] [ˈbɛd|_sprɛd_wɪθ_ʃik_stɹaɪpt_ʃits]

### [a5.11 - Listen + Repeat - SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ] Consonants](engl.io/an4)
sh[ʃ], zh[ʒ], shame[ʃeɪm], genre[ˈʒɑn-ɹә], official[əˈfɪʃ-әl], Asia[ˈeɪ-ʒә], stash[stæʃ], beige[beɪʒ]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- [ʃ]
- sh: ship [ʃɪp]
- sch: schwa [ʃwɑ]
- ti: action[ˈæk-ʃəәn]
- ci: crucial[ˈkɹu-ʃəәl]
- ssi: mission[ˈmɪʃəәn]
- s: sure [ʃʊəәɹ]
- [ʒ]
- s: usual [ˈju-ʒu-әl]
- ge: beige [beɪʒ]
- z: azure[ˈæʒ-әɹ]

## `th(θ-ð)`
These sounds are also fricatives. Here, the air passage is constricted by the tongue and the teeth. To make these sounds, the tongue tip needs to come through the teeth, just a little bit.
Students often substitute the F and V, the S and Z, or the T and D sounds. Don’t do that, get comfortable with these new sounds.

Common mistakes: aside from the substitutions, put too much of the tongue through the teeth. It should just be the tip. Also, make this a stop sound, with tension that releases. This should not be a stop, there should be a continuous flow of air. The tongue has to be relaxed for the air to flow freely.

### [v5.19 - TH[θ-ð] Consonants](engl.io/an7)
- [θ]🔇 and [ð]🔈
- For the THR consonant cluster, the lips will begin to move into position for the R while the TH is being made: three[θriː]
- In some cases, these sounds will be replaced with a similar sound, when the tongue does not quite come through the teeth. Instead it presses against the closed teeth.  This will happen in an unstressed word only, when there isn’t enough time given to the word for teeth to part and the tongue to come through: What’s in the car?[wɒts_ɪn_ðə_kɑː?]->[wɒts_ɪn_də_kɑː?]
- sample words: thin[θɪn]/this[ðɪs], thief[θif]/these[ðiz], birthday[ˈbɜɹθ-deɪ]/worthy[ˈwɜɹ-ði]
- sample sentence:  I thought of using these Lily of the Valleys rather than those thorny roses. [aɪ_θɔt‿ʌv_ˈju-zɪŋ_ðiːz_ˈlɪ-li_ɒv_ðə_ˈvæl-iz] [ˈɹæð-əɹ_ðən_ðoʊz_ˈθoʊɹ-ni_ˈroʊz-əz]

### [a5.12 - Listen + Repeat - Two TH [θ-ð] Consonants](engl.io/ap2)
th[θ], th[ð], think[θɪŋk], this[ðɪs], something[ˈsʌmˌθɪŋ], brother[bɹʌð-әɹ], with[wɪθ], loathe[loʊð]

These two sounds are only spelled with the letters ‘th’: - [θ]
- th: theme[θim]
- [ð]
- th: this[ðɪs]

## `ʧ-ʤ`
These sounds are stops and fricatives, combining the tongue position of T[t] and D[d] with the lip position of SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ]. 
The `tongue` tip is at the roof of the mouth, the `teeth` are together, and the `lips` flare. Because they are stop consonants, you cannot hold them out the way you can hold out SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ].
Stop the air in the throat with the tongue tip at the roof of the mouth, and release the air by pulling the tongue down. Unlike the stop consonants, you cannot skip the release on these words.

### [v5.19 - CH[ʧ] and JJ[ʤ] Consonants](engl.io/ap5)
- CH[ʧ]🔇 / JJ[ʤ]🔈 
- sample words: char[ʧɑɹ] /jar[ʤɑɹ], chump[ʧʌmp] /jump[ʤʌmp]
- sample sentence: I was on the edge of my seat watching each match of the major tournament. [aɪ_wʌz‿ɒn_ði_ɛʤ‿ʌv_maɪ_sit_ˈwɒʧ-ɪŋ_iʧ] [mæʧ‿ʌv_ðə_ˈmeɪʤ-əɹ_ˈtɜɹ-nə-mənt]

### [a5.13 - Listen + Repeat - CH[ʧ] and JJ[ʤ] Consonants](engl.io/ap8)
ch[ʧ], jj[dʒ], cheap[ʧip], job[ʤɑb], kitchen[ˈkɪʧ-әn], major[ˈmeɪ-ʤәɹ], much[mʌʧ], age [eɪʤ]

### [a5.14 - Listen + Repeat - SH[ʃ] vs. CH[ʧ]](engl.io/apb)
- wish[wɪʃ], which[wɪʧ]
- chin[ʧɪn], shin[ʃɪn]
- batch[bæʧ], bash[bæʃ]
- ditch[dɪʧ], dish[dɪʃ]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- [ʧ]
- ch: change[ʧeɪnʤ]
- tch: match[mæʧ]
- [dʒ]
- j: jam [ʤæm]
- g: gell [ʤεl]
- dg: budget [ˈbʌʤ-ɪt]
- di: soldier [ˈsoʊl-ʤəɹ]
- dj: adjective [ˈæʤ-ɪk-tɪv]

**Section 2: Non-Paired consonants**
## `m`
The `lips` press lightly together, and likely the `jaw` will drop just a little to get ready for the next vowel or diphthong sound. You can hold this sound out continuously. When you practice, hold it for 5 seconds and feel the buzz of the voice. This is a voiced consonant.

### [v5.21 - M[m] Consonant](engl.io/apd)
Is categorized as a nasal consonant along with N and NG[ŋ]. Air pass up over the soft palate.
- sample words: map[mæp], hammer[ˈhæm-əɹ], bottom[ˈbɒd-əm]
- sample sentence: My mom might come tomorrow morning [maɪ_mɒm‿maɪt|_kʌm_tə-ˈmɒɹ-oʊ_ˈmɔɹn-ɪŋ]

### [a5.15 - Listen + Repeat - M[m]](engl.io/apf)
mm[m], my[maɪ], human[ˈhju-mәn], some[sʌm]

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English.
- m: man[mæn]
- mm: yummy[ˈjʌm-i]

## `ŋ`
This nasal sound is a little different from [m] and [n]: it doesn’t start any words in American English. It only comes in the middle (“singer”) or at the end of a word (“ring”). It’s made by lifting the back part of the tongue to touch the lowered soft palate. The tongue tip stays down in the front, but it might not be quite touching the back of the bottom front teeth. Jaw drop and lip position don’t affect this sound, as long as the tongue is in the right position.

Because of the -ing [ɪŋ] form of verbs, this is a very common ending sound. Except in the most casual and common phrases (What are you doing? → Whatcha doin’? [ˈwʌʧ‿əˈdo-ɪn]).

The letters ‘ng’ and the the NG [ŋ] sound can be 
- ng = [ndʒ]: change [tʃeɪndʒ], angel [ˈeɪn-ʤəl]
- ng = [ng]: unglue [ʌnˈglu], engaged [εnˈgeɪʤd]
- ng = [ŋg]: angle [ˈæŋ-gәl], English [ˈɪŋ-glɪʃ]
- nk = [ŋk]: ankle [ˈæŋ-kəl], bank [bæŋk]
- nk = [nk]: unkept [ʌnˈkεpt], unkind [ʌnˈkaɪnd] (‘un’ is a prefix)

### [v5.21 - NG[ŋ] Consonant](engl.io/aph)
- sample words: sing[sɪŋ], think[θɪŋk], running[ˈɹʌn-ɪŋ]
- Sample sentence: Studying English and practicing speaking is rewarding. [ˈstʌd-i-ɪŋ_ˈɪŋg-lɪʃ_ænd|_ˈpræk-tɪs-ɪŋ] [ˈspik-ɪŋ_ɪz_ɹɪ-ˈwɔɹ-dɪŋ]

### [a5.16 - Listen + Repeat - NG[ŋ]](engl.io/apk)
ng[ŋ], song[sɔŋ], English[ˈɪŋ-glɪʃ], young[jʌŋ]

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English. 
- ng: thing [θɪŋ]
- n: thank [θæŋk]

## `n`
This is the hardest of the three nasal consonants. Is very different from NG.
It is made with the front of the tongue at the front of the mouth. Lift the tongue so it is flat and wide—this means the rest of the tongue is relaxed. The top of the front of the tongue, not the tip, will touch the roof of the mouth. The tip of the tongue will be just behind the top front teeth.
Think of keeping the back of the tongue as wide as possible. That will help keep it lower.

### [v5.23 - N[n] Consonant](engl.io/apm)
- sample words: nice[naɪs], can[kæn], dinner[ˈdɪn-əɹ]
- sample sentence: Now I don’t know when I can come. [naʊ‿aɪ_doʊnt|_noʊ‿wɛn‿aɪ_kən_kʌm]

### [v5.24 - How to Make N[n], Relating to D[d]](engl.io/app)
‘dice’ and ‘nice’. A good exercise to work on your N is to switch back and forth between syllables that start with a D and syllables that start with an N. Da-da-da-da-da, na-na-na-na-na, for example. Do use a mirror to make sure that it’s the front part of your tongue that’s raising. 

### [v5.25 - N[n] vs. NG[ŋ]](engl.io/aps)
The nn sound: feels more forward, because the part of the tongue that raises is more forward. The NG sound, it feels further back because the part of the tongue that raises is further back, that raises and touches the throat/back part of the mouth. Also, the jaw makes a small shift, but that is only to accommodate the part of the tongue that is moving. Example: Running (Run - ning)

### [v5.26 - N[n] vs NG[ŋ] Test](engl.io/apv)
wing[wiŋ], tan[tæn], song[sɔŋ], feeling[ˈfi-lɪŋ], on[ɔn], fun[fʌn], lung[lʌŋ], seeing[ˈsi-ɪŋ], done[dʌn], strong[stɹɔŋ], fine[faɪn]

### [a5.17 - Listen + Repeat - N[n]](engl.io/apx)

### [a5.18 - Listen + Repeat - N[n] vs. NG[ŋ]](engl.io/apz)
### [a5.19 - Test - N[n] vs. NG[ŋ]](engl.io/ar1)
3/5 (p115 - rta262)

- n: no [noʊ]
- nn: inn [ɪn]
- kn: know [noʊ]
- gn: gnaw [nɔ]

## `h`
The H consonant is unique because it will never end a word. It only occurs at the beginning of a word (“happy”) or in the middle (“unhappy”).

### [v5.27 - H[h] Consonant](engl.io/ar3)
This sound is simply made by passing air through a slightly constricted throat. The rest of the mouth position depends on the sound that comes next. 
- sample words: happen[ˈhæp-ən], have[hæv], home[hoʊm]
- sample sentence: He said hello to her when he got here [hi_sɛd_hə-ˈloʊ_tə_hər_wɛn_hi_gɑt|_hir]

### [a5.20 - Listen + Repeat - H [h] Consonant](engl.io/ar5)

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English. 
- h: hi[haɪ]
- wh: whole[hoʊl]

## `y`
This consonant is a ‘glide’ consonant, which is actually considered a ‘semi-vowel’. 
No words in English end in this sound, though many end in the letter Y (they [ðeɪ], by [baɪ], say [seɪ]). This sound is only at the beginning of a word (“your”) or, rarely, in the middle (“unyielding”).

To make this sound, the tip of the tongue pushes the back of the bottom front teeth. The jaw drops just a little bit and there is a little tightening in the throat. The middle part of the tongue lifts and presses against the roof of the mouth in an up and forward motion.

### [v5.28 - Y[j] Consonant](engl.io/ar8)
- sample words: yeah[jɛə], yard[jɑɹd], yield[jild], yogurt[ˈjoʊ-gəɹt]
- sample sentence: Did you buy the yellow kayak yesterday? [dɪd_jʊ_baɪ_ðə_ˈjɛl-oʊ_ˈkaɪ-æk_ˈjɛst-ər- ˌdeɪ]

This sound is only spelled with the letter Y: 
- y: yes[jεs]

## `w`
W[w] is the other glide consonant in American English. No words in English end in this sound, though many end in the letter (know [noʊ], new [nu], law [lɔ]). This sound is only at the beginning of a word (“water”), or in the middle (“unwind”).

The lips must round. There is a little tightening in the throat, just like the glide consonant Y. The tongue tip is forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth. The back part of the tongue stretches up towards the soft palate.

### [v5.29 - W[w] Consonant](engl.io/are)
- sample words: whisper[ˈwɪs-pəɹ], wish[wɪʃ], wine[waɪn]
- 'wh': can be pronounced [hw] or [w]
- sample sentence: When would you want to see the flower show? [wɛn_wʊd_ju_wɑnt|_tə_si] [ðə_ˈflaʊ-əɹ_ʃoʊ]

### [a5.22 - Listen + Repeat - W[w]](engl.io/arf)
w[w], west[wεst], walk[wɔk], unwind[ʌnˈwaɪnd]

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English.
- w: was [wʌz]
- o: one [wʌn]

## `ɹ`
the sound is mostly defined by the tongue—but because of the jaw and lip position, you can’t see the tongue.

tongue back and up. jaw only needs to drop a little bit, more of a relaxation than a drop. The middle part of the tongue can touch the middle part of the roof of the mouth, or the teeth on the upper sides of the mouth. Corners of the lips come in so the lips can flare.

There is another position that can make the R sound. curl the tip of the tongue up. It still shouldn’t touch anything. Flare your lips to help shape the sound. (como la r sp)

### [v5.30 - R[ɹ]  Consonant](engl.io/arh)
R sounds at the beginning of syllables feel more forward in the face, whereas R sounds at the end of syllables feel further back in the mouth.
- sample words: run[ɹʌn], relax[ɹɪ-ˈlæks], father[ˈfɑð-əɹ]. 
- sample sentence: Whenever Rebecca drives her car to New York, she really worries about parking it on the street. [wɛn-ˈɛv-əɹ‿ɹə-ˈbɛk-ə_dɹaɪvz_həɹ_kɑɹ] [tu_nu-jɔɹk,_ʃi_ˈɹɪ-ə-li_wɜɹ-iz‿ə-ˈbaʊt|] [ˈpɑɹ-kɪŋ_ɪd‿ɑn_ðə_stɹit]

### [a5.23 - Listen + Repeat - R[ɹ]](engl.io/arj)
r[ɹ], right [ɹaɪt], area[ˈεәɹ-i-ә], car[kɑɹ]

### [v5.31 - R[ɹ] vs W[w]](engl.io/arm)
Sometimes people make a W [w] sound instead of an R [ɹ]. This happens when the front of the tongue stays down and the back lifts. To make the R sound, do the opposite. Lift the tongue tip so it doesn’t touch anything.\
So, with the W, the tongue is stretching. With the R, the tongue is sort of pulling up into itself.

## `l`
The L consonant has two types, `Dark` and `Light`. Unfortunately, dictionaries use only one IPA symbol [l] for the two kinds,
- **light**: before the vowel or diphthong in a syllable: lie[laɪ], glass[glæs], allow[әˈlaʊ]. is made by lifting the tongue so the tip is pointed up, touching the roof of the mouth just behind the top front teeth. Alternately, some people make this by pressing the tongue tip up against the bottom of the top front teeth.  Sounds feel in the front 
- **dark**: after the vowel or diphthong in a syllable: feel[fil], syllable[ˈsɪl-ә-bәl]. It has two parts:
  1. **dark part**: pulling the back part of the tongue back. The tip stays forward, so the tip is touching the back of the bottom front teeth. It’s also flat in the mouth, not lifted. But the back part stretches back. Sounds feel in teh back
  2. **the finish**: This is made just like the Light L, lifting the tongue tip to the roof of the mouth. Most of the time, Americans will leave this part out and just make the Dark part. Example: Rachel[ˈɹeɪ-tʃəl].

### [v5.32 - L[l] Consonant](engl.io/aru)
- sample words ligh l: lap[læp], fly[flaɪ], relief[ɹɪ-ˈlif]
- saple words dark l: fill[fɪl], tool[tul], cuddle[ˈkʌd-əl]. Fall
- sample sentence: Last fall we got a good deal on last minute flights when we flew to California [læst_fɔl_wi_gɑd‿ə_gʊd|‿dil_ɑn_læst|_ˈmɪn_ɪt] [flaɪts_wɛn_wi_flu_tə‿ˌkæl-ɪ-ˈfɔrn-jə]

- l [l], oh [oʊ]
- real[ˈɹi-әl], Rio[ˈɹi-oʊ]
- kneel[nil], neo-[ˈni-oʊ]

### [a5.28 - Listen + Repeat - R[ɹ] vs L[l]](engl.io/as2)
Both of these sounds can be held out, so always hold them out for 3 or 4 seconds as you’re working on complicated words. This will solidify the correct position. Sometimes it even helps to hold your finger up to your cheek and make the shape of the tongue with your finger. Make the connection between the sound and the correct tongue position strong.

- male[meɪl], mayor[ˈmeɪ-әɹ] (dark L)

### [v5.33 - Comparing R[ɹ] and L[l]](engl.io/as4)
to make the L sound, the tongue tip is up and forward, and to make the R sound it is down and further back. In the R sound, the tip of the tongue is not touching anything. Also, in the L sound, the lips remain more neutral. In the R sound, they round somewhat. And sometimes, at the beginning of a word especially, they round a lot.
- beginning: rate, late
- end: cuddle, cutter
- middle: fearing, feeling
