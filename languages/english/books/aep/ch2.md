> Sounds don’t matter the most—character matters the most. The character is based on the placement, rhythm, and melody. We will get to the sounds, but first lay the foundation. It is your best chance at successfully transforming your spoken English.

In some languages, all syllables are the same length. In English, we have long (stressed) and short (unstressed) syllables.

### [v2.1 - A Stress-Timed Language](http://engl.io/ac2)

English is a `stress-timed language`. That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.
Many languages, however, are `syllable-timed`, which means each syllable has the same length.  Examples of syllable-timed languages:  French, Spanish, Cantonese. 

english are used to stressed syllables, syllables that will pop out of the line because they’re longer and they have more shape. Those are the `content words`.
Function words are pronounced differently: 
- to the -> `/də_ðə/`: I'm going "to the" store.
- because of -> `/kəz_ə/` => "Because of" my job.
- for -> `/fər/` => for you, for me

### Symbols
Most dictionaries will use `ˈ` to mark a syllable with primary stress, and `ˌ` to mark a syllable with secondary stress. All other syllables are unstressed.
Stressed syllables have a little curve up, then down in the voice.

### [v2.2 - Introduction to Word Stress](http://engl.io/acb)
In American English, certain words have stress within a sentence, and certain syllables have stress within a word. 

What makes a syllable stressed? It is usually higher in pitch. Also, longer in duration. 
In longer words with many syllables, there can be a primary stress and a secondary stress.

### Note
ACCENT and STRESS mean the same thing. A stressed syllable is the same as an accented syllable, an unstressed syllable is the same as an unaccented syllable.
