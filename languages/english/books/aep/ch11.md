# 11 - Contractions
A contraction is when we take two words and condense them down into one: did not → didn’t.
They’re used in writing and speech, both professional and casual. Contractions allow us to smooth out speech and make some function words shorter.

## N’T Contractions
The N’T sound is interesting: combine the nasality of the N with the stop of the T. The last syllable should feel really abrupt because of this stop quality. There is no release of the T.

### [V11.1 — N’T Contractions](engl.io/a41)
`n't`: nasal, stop abrupt, lower in pitch than the rest of the word.
- He shouldn’t be here

### [A11.1 — N’T Contractions](engl.io/a48)
- is not = isn’t [ˈɪz-әnt│]: Isn’t it nice?
- are not = aren’t [ɑɹnt│]: We aren’t late.
- was not = wasn’t [wʌz-әnt│]: It wasn’t bad.
- were not = weren’t [wɜɹnt│]: We weren’t there.
- have not = haven’t [ˈhæv-әnt│]: I haven’t seen it.
- has not = hasn’t [ˈhæz-әnt│]: He hasn’t seen it.
- had not = hadn’t [ˈhæd│әnt│]: We hadn’t heard that.
- will not = won’t [woʊnt│]: I won’t go.
- would not = wouldn’t [ˈwʊd│әnt│]: I wouldn’t say that.
- could not = couldn’t [ˈkʊd│әnt│]: I couldn’t see. 
- should not = shouldn’t [ˈʃʊd│әnt│]: I shouldn’t say this.
- do not = don’t [doʊnt│]: Don’t say that.
- does not = doesn’t [ˈdʌz-әnt│]: It doesn’t say. 
- did not = didn’t [ˈdɪd│әnt│]: We didn’t know.

## Can vs. Can’t
- CAN: unreduced [kæn], reduced [kәn]
- CAN'T: [kænt│]

### [V11.3 — CAN vs. CAN’T](engl.io/a4a)
- Often, can is reduced [kәn]. Can’t [kænt│] never reduces.
- Can’t[kænt│] is shorter and more abrupt than can[kæn] when can is not reduced and has a full vowel.

### [A11.2 — Can vs. Can’t](engl.io/a4c)
- I can hear you, I can’t hear you.
- We can come, we can’t come
- I can come, I can’t come.
- They can leave, they can’t leave.

## TO BE and TO HAVE Contractions
These two sets of contractions go together because sometimes they make the same word.

For example:
- she is → she’s [ʃiz]
- she has → she’s [ʃiz]

Question words can use ‘does’:
- who is → who’s [huz]
- who has → who’s [huz]
- who does → who’s [huz]

Three things to note about these contractions:
1. Some contractions are the same.
2. *The plural noun contractions aren’t really contractions
3. It’s = it is, which is different from “its”(shows possession)
