# 11 - Contractions
A contraction is when we take two words and condense them down into one: did not → didn’t.
They’re used in writing and speech, both professional and casual. Contractions allow us to smooth out speech and make some function words shorter.

## N’T Contractions
The N’T sound is interesting: combine the nasality of the N with the stop of the T. The last syllable should feel really abrupt because of this stop quality. There is no release of the T.

### [V11.1 — N’T Contractions](engl.io/a41)
`n't`: nasal, stop abrupt, lower in pitch than the rest of the word.
- He shouldn’t be here
