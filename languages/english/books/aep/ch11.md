# 11 - Contractions
A contraction is when we take two words and condense them down into one: did not → didn’t.
They’re used in writing and speech, both professional and casual. Contractions allow us to smooth out speech and make some function words shorter.

## N’T Contractions
The N’T sound is interesting: combine the nasality of the N with the stop of the T. The last syllable should feel really abrupt because of this stop quality. There is no release of the T.

### [V11.1 — N’T Contractions](engl.io/a41)
`n't`: nasal, stop abrupt, lower in pitch than the rest of the word.
- He shouldn’t be here

### [A11.1 — N’T Contractions](engl.io/a48)
- is not = isn’t [ˈɪz-әnt│]: Isn’t it nice?
- are not = aren’t [ɑɹnt│]: We aren’t late.
- was not = wasn’t [wʌz-әnt│]: It wasn’t bad.
- were not = weren’t [wɜɹnt│]: We weren’t there.
- have not = haven’t [ˈhæv-әnt│]: I haven’t seen it.
- has not = hasn’t [ˈhæz-әnt│]: He hasn’t seen it.
- had not = hadn’t [ˈhæd│әnt│]: We hadn’t heard that.
- will not = won’t [woʊnt│]: I won’t go.
- would not = wouldn’t [ˈwʊd│әnt│]: I wouldn’t say that.
- could not = couldn’t [ˈkʊd│әnt│]: I couldn’t see. 
- should not = shouldn’t [ˈʃʊd│әnt│]: I shouldn’t say this.
- do not = don’t [doʊnt│]: Don’t say that.
- does not = doesn’t [ˈdʌz-әnt│]: It doesn’t say. 
- did not = didn’t [ˈdɪd│әnt│]: We didn’t know.

## Can vs. Can’t
- CAN: unreduced [kæn], reduced [kәn]
- CAN'T: [kænt│]

### [V11.3 — CAN vs. CAN’T](engl.io/a4a)
- Can’t ends in a nasal n
- Often, can is reduced [kәn]. Can’t [kænt│] never reduces. The vowel sound is different
- Can’t[kænt│] is shorter and more abrupt than can[kæn] when can is not reduced and has a full vowel. In this case the vowel never change

### [A11.2 — Can vs. Can’t](engl.io/a4c)
- I can hear you, I can’t hear you.
- We can come, we can’t come
- I can come, I can’t come.
- They can leave, they can’t leave.

## TO BE and TO HAVE Contractions
These two sets of contractions go together because sometimes they make the same word.

For example:
- she is → she’s [ʃiz]
- she has → she’s [ʃiz]

Question words can use ‘does’:
- who is → who’s [huz]
- who has → who’s [huz]
- who does → who’s [huz]

  - how have = how’ve -> How’ve they already finished?
  - how does = how’s [haʊz] -> How’s that sound?

Three things to note about these contractions:
1. Some contractions are the same.
2. *The plural noun contractions aren’t really contractions
3. It’s = it is, which is different from “its”(shows possession)

### [V11.4 — TO BE Contractions](engl.io/a4e)
- `'s` is voice[z] or unvoiced[s] based on previous sound
- all set: ready
- I am crushing it: doing an excellent job
- I have a crush with someone: I have romantic interest
- my dogs are barking: your feet are tired

### [V11.5 — I’m Coming](engl.io/a4g)
- I'm coming: da-DA-da [aɪm_ˈkʌm_ɪŋ]

### [V11.6 — YOU’RE Contraction](engl.io/a1k)
Your[jɔɹ], You're[jʊəɹ,joʊɹ] => contraction [jəɹ]: 
- `J` tongue tip touch teeth, front part of the tongue is touching the roof of the mouth 
- `R`, the tongue will also touch the roof of the  mouth, but it’s further back. 
- don’t need much jaw drop for either of these sounds

### [V11.7 — Interview a Broadcaster: Erica Hill](engl.io/a4m)

### [V11.8 — That’s / It’s / What’s Reduction](engl.io/a4p)
- it is -> it’s -> [ts]
- what is -> what's -> [ts]: What's his name again?[ts‿ɪz_neɪm_əˈgɛn], What's up?[ts‿ʌp]
- that is -> that's -> [ts]: That's nice [ts‿naɪs]

Unless you have a very minimal accent, it’s probably best to pronounce the contraction: that’s, it’s, what’s.

### [A11.3 — TO BE and TO HAVE Contractions](engl.io/a4s)
- I’m [aɪm] — I’m sorry.
- I’ve [aɪv] — I’ve been there.
- You’re [jʊәr] — You’re right.
- You’ve [juv] — You’ve seen it?
- He’s [hiz] — He’s okay. [he is]
- We’re [wəɹ] — We’re going.
- We’ve [wiv] — We’ve tried.
- They’re [ðεəɹ] — They’re great.
- They’ve [ðeɪv] — They’ve known a while.
- Who’s [huz] — Who’s there? [who is]
- What’s [wʌts] — What’s it say? [what does]
- When’s [wεnz] — When’s it been better? [when has] 
- Where’s [wεəɹz] — Where’s the report? [where is] 
- Why’s [waɪz] — Why’s she here? [why is]
- How’s [haʊz] — How’s it going? [how is]

## LET’S Contraction
Let us = let’s [lɛts]. This contraction is unique because, unlike the others, we generally don’t use it in its two-word form: Let’s try again. Let’s go. Let’s wait and see.

## Modal Verb Contractions
have: would’ve, should’ve, could’ve, might’ve, must’ve.
Pronunciation
1. reduce have to [әv]: A11.4, A11.5
2. reduce them further by dropping the V sound [ә]: V11.9

### [A11.4 — Modal Verb Contractions](engl.io/a4u)
- would’ve [ˈwʊ‿dәv]: I would’ve been there
- should’ve [ˈʃʊ‿dәv]: I should’ve left.
- could’ve [ˈkʊ‿dәv]: You could’ve gotten hurt.
- might’ve [ˈmaɪ‿dәv]: That might’ve been better. 
- must’ve [ˈmʌs‿tәv]: That must’ve been hard.

### [A11.5 — Modal Verb Contractions, Slow Motion](engl.io/a4w)
- would’ve [ˈwʊ‿dәv]
- should’ve [ˈʃʊ‿dәv]
- could’ve [ˈkʊ‿dәv]
- might’ve [ˈmaɪ‿dәv]
- must’ve [ˈmʌs‿tәv]

### [V11.9 — Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda](engl.io/a4y)
These reductions sound like natural American English
- should have [ˈʃʊd-ә]
- should not have (shouldna) [ˈʃʊd-әn-ә]: It shouldn’t have started already.
- would have [ˈwʊd-ә]
- would not have (wouldna) [ˈwʊd-әn-ә]: It wouldn’t have mattered.
- could have [ˈkʊd-ә]
- could not have (couldna) [ˈkʊd-әn-ә]: You couldn't have known.

## WILL Contractions
For pronunciation, just add a Dark L to the end.
it’s much more common to reduce I’ll to make it shorter. Then it sounds like the word ‘all’ [ɔl], or even ‘all’ reduced, [əl].
It’ll [ɪd‿әl], what’ll [wʌd‿әl], and that’ll [ðæd‿el] are interesting because the final T changes to a Flap T.

### [V11.10 — We’ll see](engl.io/a51)
We’ll see: da-DA [wәlˈsi]
- `wәl` (WULL): 
  - w: lips are in a tight circle, hold-then-release the air in throat
  - dark part from dark l: lips will relax out of the circle, tongue tip, which was touching the back of the bottom front teeth for the W, stays there. The back part of the tongue stretches back a bit, making that dark sound. 
- `si`
  - s: teeth come together, and the corners of the lips might pull a little wide. The tongue tip still hasn’t moved, touching the back of the bottom front teeth. It presses there for the S. 
  - i: Tongue tip stays where it is, the teeth part a bit, and the front part of the tongue reaches towards the roof of the mouth.

### [V11.11 — I’ll think about it](engl.io/a53)
I'll think about it: da-DA-da-da-da [əl‿ˈθɪŋk‿əˈbaʊd‿ɪt|]
- link togheter smoothly
- I'll [aɪl], reduced to [əl], one sound, in casual conversation: dark sound of the dark L. Tongue tip touching the back of the bottom front teeth, and the back part is pulling back a little bit. 
- think[θɪŋk]: stressed word
  - [θ]: tongue and jaw will come up enough so your tongue tip can be lightly touching both the bottom and top teeth. The tip will come out just a little bit.
  - [ɪ]: I tend to make the IH more of an EE sound when it’s followed by the NG consonant. Tongue tip does go back down, front part of the tongue stays  close to the roof of the mouth
  - [ŋ]: Then the middle-back part of the tongue goes to the soft palate
  - [k]: your soft palate raises, it closes. Release the k into the next sound
- about[əˈbaʊd]
  - [ə]: no jaw drop, as quickly as possible
  - [b]: lips come together 
  - [aʊ]: It’s not stressed, so we don’t need too much jaw drop. The lips will probably round a little, but not too much. We want to move on to the next sound as quickly as possible.
  - [d]: Flap T. Tongue will just bounce against the roof of the mouth without stopping the flow of air. This will help us link to the next word.
- it[ɪt|]
  - [ɪ]: You don’t need to think about making the IH really, it will happen quickly when you bring your tongue down from the Flap
  - [t|]: cut off the airflow from throat, make it abrupt

### [A11.6 — ‘LL Contractions](engl.io/a56)
> Focus on the back of the tongue making the Dark L sound. Make sure you’re still saying the contraction in the sentence, and not pronouncing both words.
