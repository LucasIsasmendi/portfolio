## 1. Getting Started: Placement
**Everything you do in the rest of this book should build on what you worked on here.** Do the exercises several times

### Imitation
To begin, we’re just going to imitate vocal sounds.
1. to practice and improve imitation skills.
2. to practice and get comfortable with making new kinds of sounds.
- [a1.1](http://engl.io/ab1) Try to repeat everything exactly like you hear it.

### Placement
Placement affects the overall timbre or quality of a sound. flute vs violin
- [v1.1 - Path of the Voice](http://engl.io/ab7) Speak with the body, not with your face. The body is the fuel of the voice. Exercise. English sound from chest. Connect with the abdomen
- [v1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abf) can affect the quality of a vowel: `a`-mouth `ʌ`-chest. Play around with the vibration, not changing the pitch, only the placement nose-mouth-chest with the throat. 
- [a1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abt): feel your voice in different parts of your body. Let the voice rest low, resonance in the chest, through relaxation. Never try to force your voice down. Exercise: chest, throat, mouth, nose, top of head with, neck, with a-i-r-etc

### Relaxation

#### [v1.7 - Soft Palate](http://engl.io/abr)
There are only three sounds in English that are nasal, with a lowered soft palate. They are N[n], M[m], and NG[ŋ].
Examples words ON[an], SONG[sɔŋ]
Switch back and forth between AH and NG to feel your soft palate.
Get used to the idea of keeping your soft palate raised in all vowel sounds and most consonant sounds in American English (avoid nasal sounds)
