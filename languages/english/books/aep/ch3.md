# AEP > Vowels
# 3. Vowels
We’ve gotten to the point where we can put it all together—placement, rhythm, and the sounds: vowels.
There are eleven vowels in American English.
- [ʌ](#ʌ) UH
- [ɑ](#ɑ) AH
- [ɔ](#ɔ) AW
- [æ](#æ) AA
- [ɛ](#ɛ) EH
- [i](#i) EE
- [ɪ](#ɪ) IH
- [u](#u)
- [ʊ](#ʊ)
- [ə](#ə)
- [ɜ](#ɜ)  

## Tips
### Minimal Pairs
Listen to the minimal pairs over and over, 10 minutes a day, everyday. Once tht you start to hear the difference, start repeating with the audio file.
- `ɑ-ʌ`: [A3.4](#a34-ah-ɑ-vs-uh-ʌ)

## [a3.1 — Vowels](engl.io/ad1)
ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, æ, ɛ, i, ɪ, u, ʊ, ә, ɜ

- `stressed` ⤵️: In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up then down. Are longer, louder, have an up/down shape (intonation, or melody) in the voice, use the full voice.
- `unstressed` ➖: In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch, more relax, and a little quieter and quicker. Are shorter, flatter in pitch, quieter, and don’t use the whole voice (less air is being used).
- If any of this is still unclear or confusing, work with Chapter Two again.

## `ʌ`
This is a very relaxed sound. Because there is no tension, the placement—resonance—is low, at the base of the neck and very upper chest.
You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz]
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-əәl]
- u: up [ʌp]

### [v3.1 `ʌ` — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel](engl.io/ad4)
- stuff [stʌf]: `stressed` ⤵️
- undo [ʌn'du]: `unstressed` ➖

Notice the jaw may drop a bit more for a stressed syllable.

### [A3.2 — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel](engl.io/ad8)
- uh[ʌ]: ⤵️
- other[ˈʌð-əɹ]: ⤵️
- much[mʌtʃ]: ⤵️
- love[lʌv]: ⤵️
- uh [ʌ], uh [ʌ]* : ⤵️, ➖
- untie[ʌnˈtaɪ]: ➖
- shotgun[ˈʃɑt│ˌgʌn]: ➖

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz] 
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-әl]
- u: up [ʌp]

## `ɑ` 
like ʌ but with tension in the tongue.
The jaw drops some for this sound, and the tongue presses down in the back while the tip stays forward. Because of this tension in the tongue, the placement lifts a little bit. Though still connected to the chest, the resonance is more in the open space of the mouth. The lips are relaxed. Like all vowels, the soft palate is lifted to close the passage to the nasal cavity, letting no air through.

### [v3.2 `ɑ` — The AH as in FATHER [ɑ] Vowel](engl.io/ada)
- ⤵️: job[dʒɑb]   
- ➖: blockade[blɑ'keid]

- `lips`: The corners of the lips pull a little wide, sort of like a smile—they’re not quite relaxed.
- `tension`: little jaw and tongue tension as possible.
- `resonate`: Feel the vibration between your tongue and hard palate. But, as always, keep it connected to that lower placement at the base of the neck and upper chest.

- i: police [pәˈlis]

## `ɪ` 
- `jaw`: drops a bit more than for the EE as in SHE [i], which means the arch of the tongue isn’t as close to the roof of the mouth. 
- `tongue`: tongue tip is forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth, and the front/mid part lifts up towards the roof of the mouth.
- `lips`: lips and the corners of the lips, stay relaxed.
- `placement`: For the EE as in SHE vowel, the vibration is along the front half of the hard palate. For the IH as in SIT [ɪ] vowel, it’s more in the middle of the mouth.

**Tip**: start with the EE as in SHE [i] vowel, then create a little more space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth by dropping your jaw just a bit more.

### [v3.13 - The IH as in SIT Vowel](engl.io/aex)
- ⤵️: fix [fɪks]
- ➖: office [ˈɔ-fɪs]

### [v3.14 - EE [i] vs. IH [ɪ]](engl.io/af2)
Remember for the EE [i](she) vowel, the tongue is very close to the roof of the mouth and the corners of the lips pull wide. For the IH [ɪ](sit) vowel, the lips are relaxed and the jaw drops a little more, allowing a little more space between the arch of the tongue and the roof of the mouth.

### [v3.15 - EE, IH, and Vowel Length](engl.io/af3)

cap, cab - beat[bit], bid[bɪd] -  

### [v3.16 - Beach vs. Bitch]
- good words: [i] beach, sheet. Tongue tip is down, and the front part of the tongue is lifting, very close to the roof of the mouth EE

- o: women [ˈwɪm-ɪn]
- u: minute [ˈmɪn-ɪt]
- y: symbol [ˈsɪm-bәl]

### `u`
This vowel sounds really American when it’s more about the movement into the position than the position itself.

- `lips`: start relaxed, then round. This movement is important
- `tongue`: tip stays forward, and the back part lifts.
- `placement`: middle of the mouth

#### [v3.17 - The OO as in BOO [u] Vowel](engl.io/afh)

- ou: you [ju]
- ough: through [θɹu]
- u: flute [flut]
- ue: blue [blu]
- ui: juice [dʒus]
- wo: two [tu]

### `ʊ` 
- `tongue`: lifts in the back, towards the soft palate. Tip pulls slightly back so it’s not quite touching the back of the bottom front teeth.
- `lips`: aren’t completely relaxed: the corners of the mouth come in a little so the lips flare and push away from the face.

#### [v3.18 - The UH as in PUSH [ʊ] Vowel](engl.io/afm)
- ⤵️: took [tʊk], could [kʊd], book [bʊk], sugar[ˈʃʊg-әɹ], woman[ˈwʊm-әn],  looking [ˈlʊk ɪŋ], stood [stʊd]
- ➖: goodbye [gʊdˈbaɪ], firewood [ˈfaɪərˌwʊd], childhood [ˈʧaɪld-hʊd]

#### [a3.21 - Listen + Repeat: The UH as in PUSH [ʊ] Vowel](engl.io/afp)

#### [a3.22 - Listen + Repeat: UH [ʊ] vs. OO [u]](engl.io/afs)
OO as in BOO [u] vowel vs UH as in PUSH [ʊ] vowel. The lips round much less for UH[ʊ] than for OO[u]. Relax your lips more for the first sound, then round them more for the second.

Minimal pairs: uh[ʊ], oo[u] - stood[stʊ], stewed[stud] - pull[pʊl], pool[pul] - look[lʊk], Luke[luk] - soot[sʊt], suit[sut]

#### [a3.23 - UH [ʊ] vs. OO [u] Test](engl.io/afvs)

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- o: wolf [wʊlf]
- oo: wood [wʊd]
- ou: could [kʊd]
- u: sugar [ˈʃʊg-әɹ]

### `ə`
Knows as **schwa sound**: is only in unstressed syllables
- `lips`: part but there’s almost no jaw drop
- `tongue`: relaxed, low in the mouth, with the tip forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth
- `placement`: in the upper chest.

#### [v3.19 - The UH as in SUPPLY [əә] (Schwa) Vowel](engl.io/afx)
The schwa goes with the syllabic consonants L[əl], M[əl], N[əl], and R[əl]. That means when you have a syllable with a schwa followed by one of these consonants, you don’t need to make the schwa. It gets absorbed by the next sound.

- ➖: sofa[ˈsoʊ-fə], ability[əˈbɪl-ɪ-di], allow[əˈlaʊ], extra[ˈɛk-stɹə], data[ˈdeɪ-də], again[əˈgɛn], visa[ˈvi-zə], about[əˈbaʊt]

#### [a3.24 - Listen + Repeat: UH as in SUPPLY [əә] (Schwa)](engl.io/ag1)
- China [ˈʧaɪ-nә]

#### [a3.25 - Listen + Repeat:  Syllabic Consonants](engl.io/ag3)
The schwa is different when it’s followed by an M[m], N[N], L[l], or R[ɹ] sound. These are called syllabic consonants, which means they take over the whole syllable: you don’t need to make a schwa sound at all.
Examples: 
- system[ˈsɪs-tәm] — go straight from the T to the M. 
- open [ˈoʊp-әn] — go straight from the P to the N.
- pencil [ˈpɛn-sәl] — go straight from the S to the Dark L.
- mother [ˈmʌð-әɹ] — go straight from the TH to the R.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- a: about [əˈbaʊt]
- ea: ocean [ˈoʊ-ʃәn]
- e: anthem [ˈæn-θәm]
- eu: chauffeur (verb) [ˈʃoʊ-fәɹ]
- i: possible [ˈpɑs-ә-bəl]
- o: bottom [ˈbɑd-әm]
- ou: jealous [ˈdʒɛl-әs]
- u: autumn [ˈɔ-dәm]
- y: syringe [sәˈɹɪndʒ]

### `ɜ`
It’s basically the R consonant acting like a vowel.
The most common mistake with this sound is not lifting the tongue enough.
- `tongue`: It should be quite high in the mouth, pulled back and up so the tip isn’t touching anything.
- `lips`: corners come in so the lips can flare and push away from the face.
- `placement`: Feel the vibration in the front of the mouth, between the front of the tongue and the roof of the mouth

#### [v3.20 - The UR as in BIRD Vowel](engl.io/ag5)
- ⤵️: hurt[hɜɹt], earth[ɜɹθ], search[sɜɹʧ], circle[ˈsɜɹ-kəl], return[ɹɜˈtɜɹn]
