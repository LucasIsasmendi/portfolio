# AEP > 8. Linking
In Mandarin, you have to fully pronouncing each word. In English, like Spanish, words flow together quickly.
A general rule for linking is to link all the words together in the same thought group.
Example: "And then I thought, how’s that going to work?", 2 groups separated by comma.

There are three ways you can link words.
## 1. Linking Vowel to Vowel
- my own [maɪ‿oʊn]
- stay awhile [steɪ‿әˈwaɪl]
- why is [waɪ‿ɪz]

Remember, we’re always talking about sounds and not letters.
- three hours[θɹi‿aʊəәɹz]
