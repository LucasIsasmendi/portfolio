# AEP > 8. Linking
In Mandarin, you have to fully pronouncing each word. In English, like Spanish, words flow together quickly.
A general rule for linking is to link all the words together in the same thought group.
Example: "And then I thought, how’s that going to work?", 2 groups separated by comma.

There are three ways you can link words.
## 1. Linking Vowel to Vowel
- my own [maɪ‿oʊn]
- stay awhile [steɪ‿әˈwaɪl]
- why is [waɪ‿ɪz]

Remember, we’re always talking about sounds and not letters.
- three hours[θɹi‿aʊəәɹz]

### [V8.1 — Linking Vowel to Vowel](engl.io/ax4)
Make a constant sound with `‿`
- Did you exercise? [dɪd_ju‿ˈɛk-sər-saɪz]
- I’d like the yellow apple[aɪd_laɪk_ði_ˈjɛl-oʊ‿ˈæp-əl]
- I actually did [aɪ‿ˈæk-ʧu-ə-li_dɪd]
- don't fence me in [doʊnt|_fɛns_mi‿ɪn]
- She wants to be alone [ʃi_wɑnts_tə_bi‿ə-ˈloʊn]
- How about tomorrow? [haʊ‿ˈə-baʊt|‿təˈmɔɹ-oʊ]
- I'd be honored [aɪd_bi‿ˈɑn-əɹd]
- I almost fell on the ice [aɪ‿ˈɔl-moʊst_fɛl_ɔn_ði‿aɪs]

### [A8.2 — Linking Vowel to Vowel](engl.io/ax7)
**Glide Consonants to Help Link**: You may find it works well to think of putting a glide consonant (Y or W) between an ending vowel and a beginning vowel when linking. This will help you connect the two words. Americans do it without thinking about it.
- If the first sound is [i], [aɪ], [eɪ], or [ɔɪ], add a Y sound [j] to connect
- If the first sound is [u], [aʊ], [oʊ], or [ju] add a W sound [w] to connect

Examples:
- The apple is fresh: the apple [ði‿ˈjæ-pәl]
- The toy airplane broke: toy airplane [tɔɪ‿ˈjɛәɹ-pleɪn]
- My uncle is funny: my uncle [maɪ‿ˈjʌŋ-kәl]
- Say it quickly: say it [seɪ‿jɪt]
- The blue automobile is the fastest: blue automobile [blu‿ˈwɔ-də-mə-bil]
- How about this one: how about [haʊ‿wəәˈbaʊt]
- The slow animal was caught: slow animal [sloʊ‿ˈwæ-nə-mәl]

## 2. Linking Consonant to Vowel
when a word ends in a vowel or diphthong + T, and the next word in the thought group begins with a vowel or diphthong, make the T a Flap T [d] and link the words: about it [ә‿ˈbaʊ‿dɪt│]

### [V8.2 — Linking Consonant to Vowel](engl.io/ax9)
- Ten hours a day [tɛ‿ˈnaʊ-əɹ‿zә-deɪ]
- That's what I thought [ðæts_wʌ‿daɪ_θɔt|]
- What is it? [wʌ‿dɪ‿zɪt|]
- It's his anniversary [ɪts_hɪ‿zæn-əˈvɜrsəɹi]
- I'm on the train [aɪ‿mɔn_ðə_tɹeɪn]
- This is too much[ðɪ‿sɪz_tu_mʌʧ]
- Forget about it [fәɹˈgɜ‿dә‿ˈbaʊ‿dɪt│]

### [V8.3 — Using a Flap T to Link Words](engl.io/axa)
- part of[pɑɹd‿əv], sort of[sɔɹd‿əv] (the v sound can be drop)
- at a[æd‿ə]
- that I[ðəd‿aɪ]
### [V8.4 — My Summer Vacation](engl.io/axd)

### [A8.3 — Linking Consonant to Vowel](engl.io/axh)
- That’s what I thought: what I [wʌ‿daɪ]
- I thought about it: thought about [θɔ‿dәˈbaʊt], about it [eˈbaʊ‿dɪt|]
