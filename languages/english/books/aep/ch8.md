# AEP > 8. Linking
In Mandarin, you have to fully pronouncing each word. In English, like Spanish, words flow together quickly.
A general rule for linking is to link all the words together in the same thought group.
Example: "And then I thought, how’s that going to work?", 2 groups separated by comma.

There are three ways you can link words.
- [1. Linking Vowel to Vowel](#1-linking-vowel-to-vowel)  
- [2. Linking Consonant to Vowel](#2-linking-consonant-to-vowel)  
- [3. Linking Consonant to Consonant](#3-linking-consonant-to-consonant)  
- [Tests](#tests)

## 1. Linking Vowel to Vowel
- my own [maɪ‿oʊn]
- stay awhile [steɪ‿әˈwaɪl]
- why is [waɪ‿ɪz]

Remember, we’re always talking about sounds and not letters.
- three hours[θɹi‿aʊəәɹz]

### [V8.1 — Linking Vowel to Vowel](engl.io/ax4)
Make a constant sound with `‿`
- Did you exercise? [dɪd_ju‿ˈɛk-sər-saɪz]
- I’d like the yellow apple[aɪd_laɪk_ði_ˈjɛl-oʊ‿ˈæp-əl]
- I actually did [aɪ‿ˈæk-ʧu-ə-li_dɪd]
- don't fence me in [doʊnt|_fɛns_mi‿ɪn]
- She wants to be alone [ʃi_wɑnts_tə_bi‿ə-ˈloʊn]
- How about tomorrow? [haʊ‿ˈə-baʊt|‿təˈmɔɹ-oʊ]
- I'd be honored [aɪd_bi‿ˈɑn-əɹd]
- I almost fell on the ice [aɪ‿ˈɔl-moʊst_fɛl_ɔn_ði‿aɪs]

### [A8.2 — Linking Vowel to Vowel](engl.io/ax7)
**Glide Consonants to Help Link**: You may find it works well to think of putting a glide consonant (Y or W) between an ending vowel and a beginning vowel when linking. This will help you connect the two words. Americans do it without thinking about it.
- If the first sound is [i], [aɪ], [eɪ], or [ɔɪ], add a Y sound [j] to connect
- If the first sound is [u], [aʊ], [oʊ], or [ju] add a W sound [w] to connect

Examples:
- The apple is fresh: the apple [ði‿ˈjæ-pәl]
- The toy airplane broke: toy airplane [tɔɪ‿ˈjɛәɹ-pleɪn]
- My uncle is funny: my uncle [maɪ‿ˈjʌŋ-kәl]
- Say it quickly: say it [seɪ‿jɪt]
- The blue automobile is the fastest: blue automobile [blu‿ˈwɔ-də-mə-bil]
- How about this one: how about [haʊ‿wəәˈbaʊt]
- The slow animal was caught: slow animal [sloʊ‿ˈwæ-nə-mәl]

## 2. Linking Consonant to Vowel
when a word ends in a vowel or diphthong + T, and the next word in the thought group begins with a vowel or diphthong, make the T a Flap T [d] and link the words: about it [ә‿ˈbaʊ‿dɪt│]

### [V8.2 — Linking Consonant to Vowel](engl.io/ax9)
Taking the consonant from the end of one word and putting on the next word that begins with a vowel or diphthong, will make your speech sound much more connected, and much better linked.
- What’s up? [wɒ‿tsʌp]
- Ten hours a day [tɛ‿ˈnaʊ-əɹ‿zә-deɪ]
- That's what I thought [ðæts_wʌ‿daɪ_θɔt|]
- What is it? [wʌ‿dɪ‿zɪt|]
- It's his anniversary [ɪts_hɪ‿zæn-əˈvɜrsəɹi]
- I'm on the train [aɪ‿mɔn_ðə_tɹeɪn]
- This is too much[ðɪ‿sɪz_tu_mʌʧ]
- Forget about it [fәɹˈgɜ‿dә‿ˈbaʊ‿dɪt│]

### [V8.3 — Using a Flap T to Link Words](engl.io/axa)
- part of[pɑɹd‿əv], sort of[sɔɹd‿əv] (the v sound can be drop)
- at a[æd‿ə]
- that I[ðəd‿aɪ]
### [V8.4 — My Summer Vacation](engl.io/axd)
gonna, love it, what is, heard of, done it, can you, I'm, it's really, lemme, made it, wanna, kinda

### [V8.5 — Got it](engl.io/axf)
got it: DA-da: [ˈgɑd‿ɪt|]
- the flat T (d) the jar doesn't move, just the tongue tip

### [A8.3 — Linking Consonant to Vowel](engl.io/axh)
- That’s what I thought: what I [wʌ‿daɪ]
- I thought about it: thought about [θɔ‿dәˈbaʊt], about it [eˈbaʊ‿dɪt|]
- Is it time?: is it [ɪ‿zɪt]

## 3. Linking Consonant to Consonant
This kind of linking is the hardest because some consonants don’t link well. Just think of making them with no gap or release in between. Practice the two sounds separately first, then go straight from one sound to the next, thinking about what has to change—just like with the consonant clusters we studied in Chapter 6.
Remember: we’re talking about sounds and not letters.

### [V8.6 — Linking Consonant to Consonant](engl.io/axk)
- same consonant: gas station[gæs‿steɪ-ʃən] is not [gæs_steɪ-ʃən], some might[sʌm‿maɪt] is not [sʌm_maɪt]
- for stop consonants [t,d,p,b,k,g] it should do the stop: hot today[hɑt|_təˈdeɪ], bad dog [bæd|_dɔg] peanut butter[ˈpi-nʌt|_ˈbʌ-dəɹ], flip phone[ˈflɪp|_foʊn]
- all other cases, you’ll just need to: 
  1. isolate the two sounds in question
  2. practice separately
  3. practice together, slowly
  4. speed up
  5. Put back in context

Example: 
- It's a tough one [tʌf‿wʌn], in `f‿w` transition tongue does not move, only lips
- On Rachel's desk [ɑn‿ˈɹeɪ-ʧəlz] lips (wide -> rounded) and tongue (up tip -> back) moves togheter

> Don't rush through it. Do the opposite! It will only become comfortable if you slow it down and understand the movement that needs to happen to move from one sound to the next.

### [V8.7 — Linking and the TH](engl.io/axm)
- **S ‿ 🔇TH**: this thing[ðɪs‿θɪŋ] (tongue tip come through between teeths x2)
- **Z ‿ 🔈TH**: was that[wʌz‿ðæt] {Teeth close for the Z sound, but tongue tip doesn’t really come through the teeth for the TH. So, the tongue tip will press behind where the teeth come together, but not actually come all the way through like it does straightforward for the unvoiced TH}
- **T| ‿ 🔈TH**: sit there[sɪt|‿ðɛəɹ] {make the stop while bringing the tongue tip through the teeth}
- **V🔈 ‿ 🔈TH**: of these[əv‿ðiz] {The bottom lip comes up making contact with the top teeth for the V sound, then the lip pulls down and the tongue comes through the teeth for the TH sound}
- **P ‿ 🔈TH**: hope the[hoʊp‿ðə] {The lips come together to make the P, and as they part, the tongue tip comes through the teeth to make the TH}
- **🔇TH ‿ ST**: north star[nɔrθ‿stɑɹ] {The tongue comes through the teeth, to make the TH. Then the tongue tip pulls back and touches just behind the bottom of the front teeth while the teeth close to make the S sound. Then the tongue tip will go up to the roof of the mouth to make the T}
- **🔇TH ‿ F**: with funny[wɪθ‿ˈfʌn-i] {Tongue comes through the teeth for the TH, and the bottom lip raises to touch the bottom of the front top teeth for the F sound}
- **🔇TH ‿ W**: both will[boʊθ‿wɪl] {Tongue comes through the teeth for the TH, then pulls back and the lips form the tight circle for the W while the tongue tip is just behind the bottom front teeth}
- **🔇TH ‿ K**: health code[hɛlθ‿koʊd] {Tongue tip comes through the teeth for the TH. For the K, the tongue tip comes back in the mouth and goes down, touching behind the bottom front teeth. The back part of the tongue raises and touches the soft palate, which is why you see a dark space in the mouth}
- **🔇TH ‿ S**: south side[saʊθ‿saɪd] {Tongue tip comes through the teeth for the TH. Then the tongue tip comes back into the mouth and lightly touches behind the bottom front teeth while the teeth close to make the S sound}

> Practice word pairs like the 10 here, or other word pairs, and do them slowly. And practice them over and over. Repetition really will help you become more comfortable linking with the TH sound.

### [V8.8 — Road Trip](engl.io/axp)
How do stop consonants fit into linking? Even with the small pause, the flow of the voice can still move forward.
- road trip[ɹoʊd|‿tɹɪp], hit the road[hɪt|‿ðə_roʊd]
- fill her up[fɪll‿ˈər_ʌp]

### [V8.9 — What time?](engl.io/axr)
what time? - da-DA: [wʌt|_taɪm]

- aɪ: drop the jar for the first half of that diphthong. For the second half of the diphthong, the tongue tip stays down but the front part stretches towards the roof of the mouth, so the jaw will close some
- m: lips come together, avoid the nasal n
- This is a question and you’ll notice that the voice goes down in pitch at the end. That’s because it’s not a yes/no question. Yes/no questions tend to go up in pitch at the end but other questions will go down.

### [A8.4 — Linking the Stop T to a Consonant](engl.io/axu)
- It was raining: it was [ɪt│‿wəz]
- Wait for me: wait for [weɪt│‿fәɹ]
- Let me see that: let me [lεt│‿mi]
- I got Dad a gift: got Dad [gɑt│‿dæd]
