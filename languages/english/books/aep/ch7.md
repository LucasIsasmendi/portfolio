# AEP > 7. Rhythm and Intonation: Multi-Syllable Words
As you start to practice your pronunciation on longer words and sentences, it’s important to keep in mind the idea of intonation and flow. The pitch of an unstressed syllable should flow into the stressed syllable, and vice versa.

Smooth and connected.
Some languages are angular, but English is not. Think instead of softness. The voice is always moving up or down, never flat.

### Three-Syllable Words
Let’s start with three-syllable words. As you already know, multi-syllable words in English can only have one syllable that has primary stress. That means we have three options for stress: DA-da-da, da-DA-da, da-da-DA.

- DA is longer
- da is shorter

Spanish speakers need to work on making their long syllables longer.
One way to practice as you’re working on word stress is to break up the syllables. Practice stressed and unstressed syllables separately. For stressed, voice goes up then down in pitch.
For unstressed syllables, see just how short you can get these syllables. Try to make them extremely fast.
1. `DA-dada`: ra-tional, pop-ular
2. `da-DA-da`: de-ci-ded, e-xam-ple
3. `dada-DA`: every-day, eighty-one,

2. `da-DA-da`: tomorrow[təˈmɑˌroʊ], employer[ɛmˈplɔɪər], another[əˈnʌðər], related[rɪˈleɪtɪd]

As you learn new worlds, learn stress patterns to.

`[ˌ]`: secondary stress, will have a little of the up-down shape of the voice, but it’s not so different from an unstressed syllable. If you’re not sure what to do about them, just make them like the unstressed syllables.

- How short can you make the short syllables? How simple? Remember, the more relaxed your mouth and neck are, the more easily and quickly you can make these unstressed syllables.
- Practicing the unstressed syllables on their own, like in `A7.1`, is valuable.
