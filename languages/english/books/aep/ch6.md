# AEP > 6. Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters (also called consonant blends) are groups of two or more consonant sounds together with no vowel or diphthong between. They can occur at the beginning (street [stɹit]), middle (extra [ˈɛk-stɹə]), and end of a word (exact [ɪgˈzækt]).
It’s important to note that we’re talking about sounds, not letters. ‘Thin’ does not begin with a consonant cluster even though it begins with two consonant letters, T and H. Those two letters make just one sound, [θ].

## Beginning Consonant Clusters
can have two or three sounds.
It’s important to always practice tricky transitions slowly, holding out the sound before and after.
- 2-sound examples: blow[bloʊ], break[bɹeɪk], clean[klin], quick[kwɪk], flow[floʊ], great[gɹeɪt], please[pliz]
- 3-sound examples: street[stɹit], spring[spɹɪŋ], splash[splæʃ], square[skwεəɹ]

### Focus: R-Clusters
When you begin working with the R-clusters, hold out the R in the word as you practice. That will give you time to adjust if necessary, and feel the right position. Practice holding it out while you slowly count to three in your head. Remember, if you can’t do it right slowly, you won’t be able to do it right quickly. Slow it down until it’s right; give yourself time to prefect the tongue movement and lip rounding.
