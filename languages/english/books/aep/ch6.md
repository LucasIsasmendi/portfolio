# AEP > 6. Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters (also called consonant blends) are groups of two or more consonant sounds together with no vowel or diphthong between. They can occur at the beginning (street [stÉ¹it]), middle (extra [ËˆÉ›k-stÉ¹É™]), and end of a word (exact [ÉªgËˆzÃ¦kt]).
Itâ€™s important to note that weâ€™re talking about sounds, not letters. â€˜Thinâ€™ does not begin with a consonant cluster even though it begins with two consonant letters, T and H. Those two letters make just one sound, [Î¸].

## Beginning Consonant Clusters
can have two or three sounds.
Itâ€™s important to always practice tricky transitions slowly, holding out the sound before and after.
- 2-sound examples: blow[bloÊŠ], break[bÉ¹eÉªk], clean[klin], quick[kwÉªk], flow[floÊŠ], great[gÉ¹eÉªt], please[pliz]
- 3-sound examples: street[stÉ¹it], spring[spÉ¹ÉªÅ‹], splash[splÃ¦Êƒ], square[skwÎµÉ™É¹]

#### [a6.1 - Beginning Clusters](engl.io/at1)
- Initial two-sound consonant clusters: bl, bÉ¹, dw, dÉ¹, kl, kÉ¹, kw, fl, fÉ¹, gl, gÉ¹, pl, pÉ¹, sf, sk, sl, sm, sn, sp, st, sw, ÊƒÉ¹, tÉ¹, tw, Î¸É¹
- Initial three-sound consonant clusters: stÉ¹, spÉ¹, skÉ¹, spl, skw

### Focus: R-Clusters
When you begin working with the R-clusters, hold out the R in the word as you practice. That will give you time to adjust if necessary, and feel the right position. Practice holding it out while you slowly count to three in your head. Remember, if you canâ€™t do it right slowly, you wonâ€™t be able to do it right quickly. Slow it down until itâ€™s right; give yourself time to prefect the tongue movement and lip rounding.

#### [V6.1 - Holding Out the R Sound](engl.io/at3)
**never sacrifice correctness for more speed**.
- grin[gÉ¹Éªn], green[gÉ¹in], grain[gÉ¹eÉªn], bring[bÉ¹ÉªÅ‹], bran[bÉ¹Ã¦n], break[bÉ¹eÉªk], street[stÉ¹it], straight[stÉ¹eÉªt], creep[kÉ¹ip], pretty[ËˆpÉ¹Éªd-i], drop[dÉ¹É‘p], drill[dÉ¹Éªl]

#### [V6.2 - How to Make the SHR Cluster](engl.io/at6)
Letâ€™s take for example the word â€˜shrimpâ€™[ÊƒÉ¹Éªmp]
- `lip` position: for SH they are flared, then come into a tighter circle for the R. R at the beginning of a syllable or word has a tighter position
- `teeth` and `jaw`: they donâ€™t really move.
- `tongue`: forward for the SH sound `-`. The R, however, has a pull back `^`

- examples: shroud[ÊƒÉ¹aÊŠd], shrine[ÊƒÉ¹aÉªn], shrink[ÊƒÉ¹ÉªÅ‹k], shredder[ËˆÊƒÉ¹É›dÉ™É¹], shriek[ÊƒÉ¹ik], mushroom[ËˆmÊŒÊƒÉ¹um], dishrag[dishÉ¹ag], shrew[shÉ¹ew], washroom[ËˆwÉ‘ËŒÊƒÉ¹um], shrivel[ËˆÊƒÉ¹ÉªvÉ™l], shrub[ÊƒÉ¹ÊŒb]

`[ðŸ”¬] ojo con el chiflido`

#### [V6.3 - How to Make the TR Cluster](engl.io/at8)
`Ê§É¹`: CH+R -> `/+^`, try[Ê§É¹aÉª]
As you practice the TR cluster, slow it down and hold out the R. Make sure that youâ€™re feeling and seeing the correct tongue position. Do this over and over, drill it repetitively
- Other words: train, trade, truth, trouble, trust.

#### [V6.4 - TR Sounding like CHR](engl.io/ata)
ch/jj instead T/D in R cluster: I do want to note that though these may be the sounds that come out, they are not the sounds that a native speaker has in mind when theyâ€™re speaking.

SDR instead STR because DR are voiced, so when speaking fast, instead of unvoiced T, they put a voiced D before release the R sound. Example: string

#### [a6.2 - R Clusters](engl.io/atc)
It helps, when working with the R sound and R clusters, to hold out the sound. Hold the R sound for several seconds.

### Focus: Voiced or Unvoiced Consonants?
In consonant clusters where the second sound is unvoiced (speak [spik]), itâ€™s ok for it to sound a little voiced(â€˜sbeakâ€™). Thatâ€™s because the â€˜voiceâ€™ of the next sound is blending with that consonant. Keep that sound light. If you make a clear, strong B sound, instead of P, then it wonâ€™t sound right. This concept is discussed in the second half of the video above, TR sounding like CHR.

### Focus: [kw] Cluster
Just like with the R-clusters, you really have to round your lips for the second sound of this beginning consonant cluster. Some students skip this step, and words like â€˜quickâ€™ [kwÉªk] end up sounding like â€˜kickâ€™ [kÉªk]. The tongue tip does not need to move between these two sounds, so you only have to focus on rounding the lips. Exception: itâ€™s ok to drop the [w] sound in â€˜quarterâ€™ [ËˆkwÉ”É¹ dÉ™Ó™É¹] so it sounds like [ËˆkÉ”É¹ dÉ™Ó™É¹]. Most Americans do!

#### [V6.5 - How to Make the [kw] Cluster](engl.io/atf)
For QU[kw] sound, The key is in the lip position. When I say the word â€˜quickâ€™, my lips have already rounded before my vocal cords even release the air for the kk sound.
- sample words: quick[kwÉªk], question[ËˆkwÉ›sÊ§É™n], adequate[ËˆÃ¦dÉ™kwÉ™t], banquet[ËˆbÃ¦Å‹kwÉ™t], quiet[ËˆkwaÉªÉ™t], equate[ÉªËˆkweÉªt]

The most common mistake in making this cluster is leaving out the W sound. 

â€˜quâ€™ cluster vs kk sound
- Quit[kwÉªt], kit[kÉªt]
- Quilt[kwÉªlt], kilt[kÉªlt]
- Quote[kwoÊŠt], coat[koÊŠt]
- Quite[kwaÉªt], kite[kaÉªt]

#### [V6.6 - How to Pronounce Quarter](engl.io/ads)
quarter[ËˆkwÉ”É¹-dÉ™É¹], but most americans wonâ€™t make the W sound: [ËˆkÉ”É¹-dÉ™É¹]

### Focus: S-Clusters
Speakers of Spanish and Portuguese can have a tough time with S-clusters. These combinations donâ€™t exist at the beginning of words in those languages

#### [V6.7 - How to Pronounce S-Clusters](engl.io/atk)
study -> ~~estudy~~\
- ST: student
- STR: street[strit]
- SM: smart
- SN: snake
- SL: slap[slÃ¦p]
- SK: school[skul], scoop[skup], skip[skÉªp], square[skwÉ›r]
- SP: space
- SPL: split
- SPR: spring
- SW: swift[swÉªft]

## Middle and Ending Consonant Clusters
Though we can list the beginning consonant clusters, there are too many possibilities for clusters in the middle of and at the end of a word.
What makes them even more difficult is that some of these clusters involve stop consonants.

### Middle
#### [V6.8 - Practice Tip: NTH Cluster](engl.io/atm)
what most native speakers will do, instead of N + TH, is theyâ€™ll make the N with the tongue tip out between the teeth. Whatâ€™s happening there is just behind the tip of my tongue is raising to the gum ridge for the N, and my tongue tip is already prepared for that TH sound. 
- words: month, tenth, nineteenth

#### [V6.9 - How to Make the TS Sound](engl.io/atp)
what is the difference between the S and the TS?  A stop, the T stop [t|]. 
Rather than lifting the tip for the T, the tip stays down here. And itâ€™s further back, the front part of the tongue, but not the tip, that will raise and touch the roof of the mouth, to cut off the air flow.
So rather than the tip coming up, itâ€™s simply the front part raising. 
- Practice: s-- + t|^. t|^+s--
- words: let's, what's, cats, it's, that's, fights, guts

#### [V6.10 - Dropping T and D between Consonants](engl.io/akv)
When the T and D sounds come between two other consonant sounds, many Americans will drop them. `Check v5.9`
- examples: must be, just one[dÊ’ÊŒs_wÊŒn], stand for, exactly, grand piano

#### [V6.11 - Study: Ending T Clusters in Real English](engl.io/atu)
- T drop: just confirm, just by, just the, 
- L drop: already[É”lËˆrÉ›d-i]->[É”ËˆrÉ›d-i], alright[ËŒÉ”lËˆraÉªt]->[ËŒÉ”ËˆraÉªt]
- Homophone: flour-flower[ËˆflaÊŠÉ™r], need-knead[nid], yolk-yoke[joÊŠk]
- H drop: you have|had|her|his a [jÊŠ_hÉ™v_eÉª]->[jÊŠâ€¿Ã¦vâ€¿É™]
- reductions: want to -> wanna[ËˆwÊŒn-É™], because -> cuz[kÉ™z]

### Ending
#### Plural Nouns & -ed Endings
Making a plural noun, or adding an -ed ending to make a regular verb past tense, often makes a consonant cluster at the end of the word. 

#### Regular Plural Nouns
When is the â€˜sâ€™ pronounced [s] and when [z]? Remember that all vowels and diphthongs are voiced, so they all follow the rule for a voiced ending, where the plural adds a [z] sound.

Weâ€™re talking about final sounds, not final letters. Whatâ€™s important is that the word â€˜tubeâ€™ [tub], ends in the consonant sound [b], not the vowel letter â€˜eâ€™.

final sound -> plural pronunciation
- `voiced` -> `s[z]` : cube+s[kjubz], bed+s[bÎµdz], egg+s[Îµgz], executive+s[ÉªgËˆzÎµk-jÓ™-dÉªvz], bomb+s[bÉ‘mz], son+s[sÊŒnz], song+s[sÉ”Å‹z], pill+s[pÉªlz], flower+s[ËˆflaÊŠ-Ó™É¹z], lathe+s[leÉªÃ°z]
- `unvoiced` -> `s[s]`: tip+s[tÉªps], bit+s[bÉªts], trick+s[tÉ¹Éªks],  roof+s*[É¹ufs], month+s[mÊŒnÎ¸s]
- `special cases` -> `s or es = [Éªz]`: glass+es[ËˆglÃ¦s-Éªz], size+s [ËˆsaÉªz-Éªz], wish+es[ËˆwÉªÊƒ-Éªz], garage+s[gÓ™ËˆÉ¹É‘Ê’-Éªz], match+es[ËˆmÃ¦Ê§-Éªz], page+s[peÉª-Ê¤Éªz]
- `*` Note: Plurals of words that end in -f or -fe usually change: drop the -f or -fe, add -ves. Example: leaf[lif] â€” leaves[livz].
- [Éªz] syllable is always unstressed, so make it very short.

#### [V6.12 - How to Pronounce Plural Nouns](engl.io/atz)
1. Voiced [z]: 
   - vowel: trees[triz]
   - diphthong: cafe[kÃ¦ËˆfeÉªz]
   - consonants: [B t g v m n Å‹ L É¹ Ã°], apple[ËˆÃ¦p-É™lz]
2. Unvoiced [s]:
   - ships[ÊƒÉªps]
   - consonants: [p t k f Î¸]
3. special cases -es[Éªz]
   - ending sounds: [s z Êƒ Ê’ Ê§ Ê¤]: wish+es[ËˆwÉªÊƒ-Éªz]

Examples: age+s[ËˆeÉªÊ¤-Éªz](3), time+s[taÉªmz], box+es[ËˆbÉ‘ks-Éªz](3), dog+s[dÉ‘gz](1), cat+s[kÃ¦ts](2)

#### [A6.4 â€” Plural Nouns](engl.io/au2)
- [z]: cubes, beds 
- [s]: tips, bits
- [Éªz]: glasses, sizes

Remember these rules are for regular plural nouns, where you add -s or -es. There are, of course, some irregular nouns that do their own thing. For example: child->children,  man->men, moose->moose, nucleus->nuclei, mouse->mice
