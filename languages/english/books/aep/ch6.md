# AEP > 6. Consonant Clusters

Consonant clusters (also called consonant blends) are groups of two or more consonant sounds together with no vowel or diphthong between. They can occur at the beginning (street [stɹit]), middle (extra [ˈɛk-stɹə]), and end of a word (exact [ɪgˈzækt]).
It’s important to note that we’re talking about sounds, not letters. ‘Thin’ does not begin with a consonant cluster even though it begins with two consonant letters, T and H. Those two letters make just one sound, [θ].

## Beginning Consonant Clusters
can have two or three sounds.
It’s important to always practice tricky transitions slowly, holding out the sound before and after.
- 2-sound examples: blow[bloʊ], break[bɹeɪk], clean[klin], quick[kwɪk], flow[floʊ], great[gɹeɪt], please[pliz]
- 3-sound examples: street[stɹit], spring[spɹɪŋ], splash[splæʃ], square[skwεəɹ]

#### [a6.1 - Beginning Clusters](engl.io/at1)
- Initial two-sound consonant clusters: bl, bɹ, dw, dɹ, kl, kɹ, kw, fl, fɹ, gl, gɹ, pl, pɹ, sf, sk, sl, sm, sn, sp, st, sw, ʃɹ, tɹ, tw, θɹ
- Initial three-sound consonant clusters: stɹ, spɹ, skɹ, spl, skw

### Focus: R-Clusters
When you begin working with the R-clusters, hold out the R in the word as you practice. That will give you time to adjust if necessary, and feel the right position. Practice holding it out while you slowly count to three in your head. Remember, if you can’t do it right slowly, you won’t be able to do it right quickly. Slow it down until it’s right; give yourself time to prefect the tongue movement and lip rounding.

#### [V6.1 - Holding Out the R Sound](engl.io/at3)
**never sacrifice correctness for more speed**.
- grin[gɹɪn], green[gɹin], grain[gɹeɪn], bring[bɹɪŋ], bran[bɹæn], break[bɹeɪk], street[stɹit], straight[stɹeɪt], creep[kɹip], pretty[ˈpɹɪd-i], drop[dɹɑp], drill[dɹɪl]

#### [V6.2 - How to Make the SHR Cluster](engl.io/at6)
Let’s take for example the word ‘shrimp’[ʃɹɪmp]
- `lip` position: for SH they are flared, then come into a tighter circle for the R. R at the beginning of a syllable or word has a tighter position
- `teeth` and `jaw`: they don’t really move.
- `tongue`: forward for the SH sound `-`. The R, however, has a pull back `^`

- examples: shroud[ʃɹaʊd], shrine[ʃɹaɪn], shrink[ʃɹɪŋk], shredder[ˈʃɹɛdəɹ], shriek[ʃɹik], mushroom[ˈmʌʃɹum], dishrag[dishɹag], shrew[shɹew], washroom[ˈwɑˌʃɹum], shrivel[ˈʃɹɪvəl], shrub[ʃɹʌb]

#### [V6.3 - How to Make the TR Cluster](engl.io/at8)
`ʧɹ`: CH+R -> `/+^`, try[ʧɹaɪ]
As you practice the TR cluster, slow it down and hold out the R. Make sure that you’re feeling and seeing the correct tongue position. Do this over and over, drill it repetitively
- Other words: train, trade, truth, trouble, trust.

#### [V6.3 - TR Sounding like CHR](engl.io/ata)
ch/jj instead T/D in R cluster: I do want to note that though these may be the sounds that come out, they are not the sounds that a native speaker has in mind when they’re speaking.

SDR instead STR because DR are voiced, so when speaking fast, instead of unvoiced T, they put a voiced D before release the R sound. Example: string

#### [a6.2 - R Clusters](engl.io/atc)
It helps, when working with the R sound and R clusters, to hold out the sound. Hold the R sound for several seconds.
