# 9. Rhythm and Intonation: Stresses Words
Now you’re ready to study the rhythm and intonation of sentences. You’ve already learned some important points:
- linking and flow: the melody of English is smooth, not angular or choppy, with a forward flow of the voice.
- intonation: the melody or shape of a stressed syllable goes up and then down in a curve, like this: ⤵️. Unstressed syllables will be flatter and lower in pitch ➖.
- rhythm: stressed syllables are longer, louder, and have more energy in the voice. Unstressed syllables are very quick and are less clear.

All of these points apply to whole phrases. 
Let’s look at the example da-DA-da. This is the stress pattern of ‘computer’, ‘example’, ‘another’. It’s also the stress pattern for the phrases ‘I want it,’ ‘I need it’, ‘I saw you’, and ‘You know it’.

Since they are the stressed words in a sentence, that means their stressed syllables should be the longest, loudest, clearest syllables of the sentence. They should have the up-down shape of a stressed syllable ⤵️.
