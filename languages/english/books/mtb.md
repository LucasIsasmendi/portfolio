## 3. Punctuation
The `semi-colon` (;) is used:
- to separate closely related independent clauses: 
  - *He is my son; I love him.*
  - *She is my friend; besides, I love her.*
  - between items in a series, when commas have already been used: *I like ice cream with chocolate, cherries, and whipped cream; cookies, cake, and pie; and all other rich desserts.*

The `colon` (:) is used to call attention to an explanation or list: *They need the following: bread, milk, sugar, flour, and salt.*

The `dash` (—) is used to emphasize information within a sentence: *Everything they need—bread, milk, sugar, flour, and salt—is at the corner store.*

The `hyphen` (-) is used:
- to connect the parts of a compound word: *seventy-eight, make-up*
- to connect certain prefixes with words: *re-use, pre-approve*

## 5. Nouns
### Possessive
#### “Whose?”
A possessive noun tells who “has” something. It answers the question, “Whose?”
1. add `’s` to a singular noun: the book that Mary owns. Whose book? Mary’s 
2. add `’s` to a plural noun that does not end in s: the money that the people have. Whose money? the people’s
3. add `’` to a plural noun that ends in s: the party that the ladies have. Whose party? the ladies’
4. use `a + (noun) + of + the possessive noun` to indicate that the item owned is only one of several: a book that Mary has. Whose book? a book of Mary’s

#### Prepositional phrase: “of, the, for”
Use the possessive form to show ownership by people. Do not use of the with people: John’s book

Use either the possessive form or the prepositional phrase of the with: 
- other living or natural things: the plant’s leaves/the leaves of the plant
- certain time expressions: today’s date/the date of today, tomorrow’s agenda/the agenda for tomorrow

Do not use the possessive form for other nonliving things. Show possession with `of the`: the rooms of the house, the name of that street

### Comparing
#### by number or amount
- to show differences:
  - more|fewer|less(non-count) + noun + than + noun: I have more|fewer|less pencils than pens.
  - more|fewer|less(non-count) + noun + than + subject + (verb): I have more|fewer|less pencils than you (do).
- To show equality
  - as many|the same number/amount of|as much(non-count) + noun + as + noun: I have as many notebooks as books.
  - as many|the same number/amount of|as much(non-count) + noun + as + subject + (verb): I have as many notebooks as he does.

#### Equality of Size,Weight, Shape, and Color
For singular, plural and non-count nouns, use: the same + noun + as: Our dresses are the same size.

#### Absolute Equality
To show that two nouns are equal in every way, use:
- exactly like + noun | exactly alike: Your dress is exactly like my dress. Our dresses are exactly alike.
- the same as + noun | the same: Your dress is the same as my dress. Our dresses are the same.

## 6. Pronouns
### Object
- Subject Pronoun: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
- Object Pronoun: me, you, him, her, it, us, them

#### Using Two Object Pronouns Together
When there is an indirect object pronoun before the direct object, the direct object must be in noun—not pronoun— form.
- He gaves me the book. (X: he gave me it)
- I’ll show you my new dresses. (X: I’ll show you them)

To use the direct object pronoun with an indirect object pronoun, use a preposition.
- He gave me the book. -> He gave it to me.
- I’ll show you my new dresses. -> I’ll show them to you.

### Reciprocal
- **each other** refers to a relationship between two people or groups.
- **one another** is used to refer to a relationship among three or more people.

### Intensive and Reflexive
- myself, ourselves, yourself, yourselves, himself, themselves, herself,
itself
- An **intensive pronoun** restates a subject noun or pronoun, to emphasize it: I vote “no” myself.
- A **reflexive pronoun** is an object pronoun that refers back to the subject. The subject and the object are the same person or thing: I cut myself. Did you cure yourself?
- The preposition `by + a reflexive pronoun` means “alone”: She is by herself. (She is alone)

### Possessive
A possessive pronoun replaces a possessive noun. It answers the question, “Whose?”
- mine, yours, his, hers, ours, yours, theirs

To show possession, you can also use `It belongs to + noun or object pronoun`: Whose book is it? It belongs to me -> It’s mine.

### Relative
- who, whom, whose, which, that
- replaces a noun in an adjective clause. It answers the questions “Who...?”“Whom...?”“Whose...?”“Which...?” “What...?” and “What kind of...?”
- What kind of book do you want? I want a book that has pictures.

### Demostrative
indicates a specific noun. It Specific Noun answers the questions “Which?” “Which one?” and “Which ones?”
- close: `this` (singular), `these` (plural)
- farther away: `that` (singular), `those` (plural)
- `one` refers to a specific item already named. (X: after these and those, do not use)

### Indefinite
Singulars indefinite refers to a noun that is not specific.
- people: 
  - one of all people: anybody, anyone. Anybody can do it.
  - not one person: not anybody, not anyone, nobody, no one. Nobody can do it.
  - one person: somebody, someone. Somebody can help us.

## 7. Adjectives

- noun determiners: identify and limit nouns. I have a watch (X: I have watch)
- descriptive adjectives: their use is optional. I have a beautiful watch.

### Noun Determiners
#### Articles
An article helps identify a noun -a, an, the
- `a`: It answers the question, “What is it?” or “Who is it?”. Use `an` before a singular noun that begins with a vowel sound.
- `the`: answers the question, “What (noun)?” or “Which one(s)?”
  - Do not use it with certain singular proper nouns: January, Monday
  - Use it before other singular proper noun: the United Kingdom, the Western Hemisphere

#### Verbs Used as Adjectives

- Participles that describe people can be confusing. Remember: the “ing” form is the cause (If the movie is exciting,), the “ed” form is the effect (the audience is excited.)

#### Compound Adjectives
a combination of two or more words joined by hyphens and used to describe a noun: an all-night party, an up-to-date analysis

#### Comparing Descriptive Adjectives
- To strengthen an adjective
  1. add `er` to a one-syllable adjective: cheap, clean
  2. add `r` to one-syllable adjectives that en in `e`: nice, close
  3. one-syllable adjective ending in consonant + vowel + consonant = double the last consonant and add `er`: big » bigger, fat » fatter
  4. drop the y and add /erto two- syllable adjectives that end in y: happy » happier, easy » easier
  6. put more before other two-or-more-syllable adjectives: more capable, more difficult
- To weaken an adjective
  - 1-5) put `not as` before the adjective: not as cheap, not as clean, not as nice, not as close

#### Superlative Adjectives
A superlative adjective distinguishes one noun from three or more. 
To make an adjective superlative:
1. put `the` before the adjective, and add `st` instead of `r`: the biggest, the easiest
2. add the most instead of more before the adjective: the most important, the most wonderful
3. use the irregular form for the following adjectives: good»the best, many»the most

To make a superlative negative, put `the least` before the adjective: the least important, the least funny

### Order Of Adjectives
To describe a noun with several adjectives, use the following order. It is better not to use more than three descriptive adjectives together.
1. a noun determiner: a, the, my, this, etc
2. a subjective descriptive adjective: wonderful, crazy, tired, etc
3. factual descriptive adjectives: size (big, small), shape (roud, square), age(new, old), color, origin, material (glass, wood, silk)
4. the noun: chair, furniture

Examples:
