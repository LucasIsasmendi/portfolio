## 3. Punctuation
The `semi-colon` (;) is used:
- to separate closely related independent clauses: 
  - *He is my son; I love him.*
  - *She is my friend; besides, I love her.*
  - between items in a series, when commas have already been used: *I like ice cream with chocolate, cherries, and whipped cream; cookies, cake, and pie; and all other rich desserts.*

The `colon` (:) is used to call attention to an explanation or list: *They need the following: bread, milk, sugar, flour, and salt.*

The `dash` (—) is used to emphasize information within a sentence: *Everything they need—bread, milk, sugar, flour, and salt—is at the corner store.*

The `hyphen` (-) is used:
- to connect the parts of a compound word: *seventy-eight, make-up*
- to connect certain prefixes with words: *re-use, pre-approve*

## 5. Nouns
### Possessive
#### “Whose?”
A possessive noun tells who “has” something. It answers the question, “Whose?”
1. add `’s` to a singular noun: the book that Mary owns. Whose book? Mary’s 
2. add `’s` to a plural noun that does not end in s: the money that the people have. Whose money? the people’s
3. add `’` to a plural noun that ends in s: the party that the ladies have. Whose party? the ladies’
4. use `a + (noun) + of + the possessive noun` to indicate that the item owned is only one of several: a book that Mary has. Whose book? a book of Mary’s

#### Prepositional phrase: “of, the, for”
Use the possessive form to show ownership by people. Do not use of the with people: John’s book

Use either the possessive form or the prepositional phrase of the with: 
- other living or natural things: the plant’s leaves/the leaves of the plant
- certain time expressions: today’s date/the date of today, tomorrow’s agenda/the agenda for tomorrow

Do not use the possessive form for other nonliving things. Show possession with `of the`: the rooms of the house, the name of that street

### Comparing
#### by number or amount
- to show differences:
  - more|fewer|less(non-count) + noun + than + noun: I have more|fewer|less pencils than pens.
  - more|fewer|less(non-count) + noun + than + subject + (verb): I have more|fewer|less pencils than you (do).
- To show equality
  - as many|the same number/amount of|as much(non-count) + noun + as + noun: I have as many notebooks as books.
  - as many|the same number/amount of|as much(non-count) + noun + as + subject + (verb): I have as many notebooks as he does.

#### Equality of Size,Weight, Shape, and Color
For singular, plural and non-count nouns, use: the same + noun + as: Our dresses are the same size.

- exactly like + noun | exactly alike: Your dress is exactly like my dress. Our dresses are exactly alike.
- the same as + noun | the same: Your dress is the same as my dress. Our dresses are the same.
