#### Consonant Articulation | Sound
- We use the articulators: tongue, lips & teeth, to block air.
- The places where we block air in English are shown below.

Exercise
1. f / v
2. t / d / l / n
3. m / p / b
4. k / g / ŋ
5. θ / ð

### Vowel Articulation| Sounds
- A vowel sound is made by shaping the mouth as air flows out.
- Articulators used to shape the mouth are: tongue, lips and jaw.

### Introduction | Spelling & Sound
- English spelling does not always indicate pronunciation.
- It was famously claimed that the word ‘fish’ could be spelt ‘ghoti’
- The pronunciation of many English sounds can be predicted by their spelling.
- The ‘Spelling & Sound’ section shows you how to select sounds accurately by interpreting spelling.

### Schwa | Spelling & Sound (very UK)
- The schwa sound /ə/ can be spelt as < a >, < e >, < o > and < u >.
- The schwa is the most common vowel sound in English.
- The schwa is weak - it can never be stressed.
- The production of the schwa is neutral: lips, jaw and tongue are relaxed

### Function & Content | Structure
- Spoken English is divided into function and content words.
- **Function words** carry only grammatical meaning, such as:
  - prepositions: to from for of with by
  - auxiliaries: are was do have could would shall can
  - articles: a an the
  - quantifiers: some any few all
  - pronouns: he she it you I this that
- **Content words** carry real meaning such as:
  - nouns: car wedding James table joy
  - verbs: move drink turn enjoy think
  - adjectives: big interesting quiet slow bright
  - adverbs: quickly quietly fortunately often again

[*] Pay attention to the content, not to the intonation

### Schwa Function Words | Structure
- Many function words are pronounced with schwa when they are weak.
- If a function word is stressed, it can not be pronounced with schwa.
- Function words are always strong when said alone.
to /tu:/ -> /tə/
are /ɑ:/ -> /ə/
was /wɒz/ -> /wəz/
from /frɒm/ -> /frəm/
there /ðeə/ -> /ðə/
can /kæn/ -> /kən/
her /hɜ:/ -> /hə/
for /fɔ:/ -> /fə/

### Introduction | Intonation
1. ↘Yes   ->  maybe
2. ↘↗Yes  ->  definitely
3. ↗Yes   -> why are yo uasking me?

- Spoken English uses 3 intonation patterns - fall, fall-rise & rise.
- Intonation shows us the speaker’s attitude to what they are saying.

### Usage | Intonation
- Intonation shows us a speaker’s attitude to their words.
- This course will show you how to produce English intonation in your speech.
- Some important examples of intonation usage are displayed below.

### IPA | Postscript
- IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) shows the way we pronounce words.
- In English, the pronunciation of a word often differs from its spelling, making
IPA a very useful study tool to improve your pronunciation.
- Stress is marked in IPA using the symbol **/ ˈ/**.

## Chapter 1

### Fricative Consonants | Sounds

### < th > | Sound Comparison

/θ/ is a **voiceless** sound; it is made by squeezing air past the teeth.
/ð/ is a **voiced** sound, the throat vibrates whilst air is pushed past the teeth.

#### EXERCISE th pronunciation - Chapter-1-1.4.mp3

### < s > Endings | Spelling & Sound
When we add an < s > to a word (root), the following rule applies:
- Root words ending in voiceless sounds + < s > will be pronounced /s/:
EXAMPLES: bits, shops, wants
- Root words ending in voiced sounds + < s > will be pronounced /z/:
EXAMPLES: shoes, things, ways
- Root words ending in: /s, z, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ/ + < s > will be pronounced /ɪz/:
EXAMPLES: faces, watches, cages

### Schwa | Structure
- Function words are normally weak in pronunciation.
- Many function words are pronounced with a schwa when they are weak.

### Stressed Function Words | Structure
- Function words **are not pronounced with schwa** if they are:
1. Stressed due to meaning.
EXAMPLE:
A Is that present from David?
B No, it’s *for* David!
2. At the end of the sentence/unit:
EXAMPLE:
A Who’s the present *for*?
B It’s for John.

### Sentence Stress | Intonation
- In spoken English we **stress content words**.
- **One word in every sentence** is more stressed than the others.
- Normally the **last content word** is the most stressed word.

DRILL: . x . X | a *pair* of **shoes**

### Tonic Syllable | Intonation
- **One word** carries more stress than the others in all sentences.
- This stressed word is called the **‘tonic syllable’**.
- Normally the tonic syllable is found in the **last content word** of the sentence.

### Homographs | Postscript
- Homographs are words that are spelt the same but pronounced differently.
