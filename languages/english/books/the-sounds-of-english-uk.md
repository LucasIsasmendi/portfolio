### Introduction | Spelling & Sound
- English spelling does not always indicate pronunciation.
- It was famously claimed that the word ‘fish’ could be spelt ‘ghoti’
- The pronunciation of many English sounds can be predicted by their spelling.
- The ‘Spelling & Sound’ section shows you how to select sounds accurately by interpreting spelling.

### Schwa | Spelling & Sound (very UK)
- The schwa sound /ə/ can be spelt as < a >, < e >, < o > and < u >.
- The schwa is the most common vowel sound in English.
- The schwa is weak - it can never be stressed.
- The production of the schwa is neutral: lips, jaw and tongue are relaxed

### Function & Content | Structure
- Spoken English is divided into function and content words.
- **Function words** carry only grammatical meaning, such as:
  - prepositions: to from for of with by
  - auxiliaries: are was do have could would shall can
  - articles: a an the
  - quantifiers: some any few all
  - pronouns: he she it you I this that
- **Content words** carry real meaning such as:
  - nouns: car wedding James table joy
  - verbs: move drink turn enjoy think
  - adjectives: big interesting quiet slow bright
  - adverbs: quickly quietly fortunately often again

[*] Pay attention to the content, not to the intonation

### Schwa Function Words | Structure
- Many function words are pronounced with schwa when they are weak.
- If a function word is stressed, it can not be pronounced with schwa.
- Function words are always strong when said alone.
to /tu:/ -> /tə/
are /ɑ:/ -> /ə/
was /wɒz/ -> /wəz/
from /frɒm/ -> /frəm/
there /ðeə/ -> /ðə/
