## Introduction
#### Consonant Types | Sound
- Consonant sounds are produced by blocking air as it leaves the mouth.
- This course shows you how to pronounce all 25 consonant sounds of English.

> TODO: copy table

#### Consonant Articulation | Sound
- We use the articulators: tongue, lips & teeth, to block air.
- The places where we block air in English are shown below.

Exercise
1. f / v
2. t / d / l / n
3. m / p / b
4. k / g / ŋ
5. θ / ð
6. h / ʔ

#### Vowels | Sounds
- A neutral English accent has 19 vowel sounds.
- There are 3 types of English vowel sound - short, long and diphthong.
- English spelling does not always show us which sound to pronounce.

> TODO: copy table
`Audio-Introduction-0.3.mp3`

### Vowel Articulation| Sounds
- A vowel sound is made by shaping the mouth as air flows out.
- Articulators used to shape the mouth are: tongue, lips and jaw.

### Introduction | Spelling & Sound
- English spelling does not always indicate pronunciation.
- It was famously claimed that the word ‘fish’ could be spelt ‘ghoti’
- The pronunciation of many English sounds can be predicted by their spelling.
- The ‘Spelling & Sound’ section shows you how to select sounds accurately by interpreting spelling.

### Schwa | Spelling & Sound (very UK)
- The schwa sound /ə/ can be spelt as < a >, < e >, < o > and < u >.
- The schwa is the most common vowel sound in English.
- The schwa is weak - it can never be stressed.
- The production of the schwa is neutral: lips, jaw and tongue are relaxed

### Function & Content | Structure
- Spoken English is divided into function and content words.
- **Function words** carry only grammatical meaning, such as:
  - prepositions: to from for of with by
  - auxiliaries: are was do have could would shall can
  - articles: a an the
  - quantifiers: some any few all
  - pronouns: he she it you I this that
- **Content words** carry real meaning such as:
  - nouns: car wedding James table joy
  - verbs: move drink turn enjoy think
  - adjectives: big interesting quiet slow bright
  - adverbs: quickly quietly fortunately often again

[*] Pay attention to the content, not to the intonation

### Schwa Function Words | Structure
- Many function words are pronounced with schwa when they are weak.
- If a function word is stressed, it can not be pronounced with schwa.
- Function words are always strong when said alone.
to /tu:/ -> /tə/
are /ɑ:/ -> /ə/
was /wɒz/ -> /wəz/
from /frɒm/ -> /frəm/
there /ðeə/ -> /ðə/
can /kæn/ -> /kən/
her /hɜ:/ -> /hə/
for /fɔ:/ -> /fə/

### Introduction | Intonation
1. ↘Yes   ->  maybe
2. ↘↗Yes  ->  definitely
3. ↗Yes   -> why are yo uasking me?

- Spoken English uses 3 intonation patterns - fall, fall-rise & rise.
- Intonation shows us the speaker’s attitude to what they are saying.

### Usage | Intonation
- Intonation shows us a speaker’s attitude to their words.
- This course will show you how to produce English intonation in your speech.
- Some important examples of intonation usage are displayed below.

### IPA | Postscript
- IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) shows the way we pronounce words.
- In English, the pronunciation of a word often differs from its spelling, making
IPA a very useful study tool to improve your pronunciation.
- Stress is marked in IPA using the symbol **/ ˈ/**.

## Chapter 1

### Fricative Consonants | Sounds
f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ
- Fricatives are made by squeezing air between two articulators.
- There are 9 fricative consonant sounds in English (see chapter 5 for /h/):

### DRILL

> TODO: Practicar!! `Chapter-1-1.2.mp3` f θ s ʃ - v ð z ʒ 

### < th > | Sound Comparison

/θ/ is a **voiceless** sound; it is made by squeezing air past the teeth.
/ð/ is a **voiced** sound, the throat vibrates whilst air is pushed past the teeth.

#### EXERCISE th pronunciation - Chapter-1-1.4.mp3

### < s > Endings | Spelling & Sound
When we add an < s > to a word (root), the following rule applies:
- Root words ending in voiceless sounds + < s > will be pronounced /s/:
EXAMPLES: bits, shops, wants
- Root words ending in voiced sounds + < s > will be pronounced /z/:
EXAMPLES: shoes, things, ways
- Root words ending in: /s, z, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ/ + < s > will be pronounced /ɪz/:
EXAMPLES: faces, watches, cages

> Listen rule: `Chapter-1-1.7.mp3`

#### DRILL
> TODO: Practicar!! `Chapter-1-1.8.mp3` s - z - ɪz

### Schwa | Structure
- Function words are normally weak in pronunciation.
- Many function words are pronounced with a schwa when they are weak.

### Stressed Function Words | Structure
- Function words **are not pronounced with schwa** if they are:
1. Stressed due to meaning.
EXAMPLE:
A Is that present from David?
B No, it’s *for* David!
2. At the end of the sentence/unit:
EXAMPLE:
A Who’s the present *for*?
B It’s for John.

> TODO: Practice `Chapter-1-1.15.mp3`

### Sentence Stress | Intonation
- In spoken English we **stress content words**.
- **One word in every sentence** is more stressed than the others.
- Normally the **last content word** is the most stressed word.

DRILL: . x . X | a *pair* of **shoes**

### Tonic Syllable | Intonation
- **One word** carries more stress than the others in all sentences.
- This stressed word is called the **‘tonic syllable’**.
- Normally the tonic syllable is found in the **last content word** of the sentence.

### Homographs | Postscript
- Homographs are words that are spelt the same but pronounced differently.
read: /ri:d/ /red/

## Chapter 2
### Long Vowels | Sounds
- Spoken English contains 5 long vowel sounds.
- Each long vowel uses one unique position of the mouth.
- Every long vowel sound has several possible spellings.

> TODO: Copy table - Practice `Chapter-2-2.2.mp3`
> TODO: Exercise `Chapter-2-2.3.mp3` -> Errors with `ɜ:`

### ɪ vs i: | Sound Comparison
- There are 2 clear differences between the vowel sounds /ɪ/ and /i:/ :
  1. The position of the mouth.
  2. /i:/ is normally (though not always) longer than /ɪ/ .
- /i:/ is spelt with two vowels < ee / ei / ie / ea > in written English.
- /ɪ/ is spelt as < i > in written English (except when weak

> TODO: Listen to `Chapter-2-2.6.mp3` and `Chapter-2-2.7.mp3`

### < r > | Spelling & Sound 
:-1:
- In British English we do not pronounce every written < r >.
- If an < r > appears before a vowel sound, we pronounce it:
  EXAMPLES: rat, rice, pretty, strain, cry, story
- If an < r > appears after a vowel sound, we do not pronounce it.
  EXAMPLES: car, court, learn, shorter, store

Examples `Chapter-2-2.10.mp3`

### Two Syllable Words | Structure
- All English words of 2 syllables or more contain one main stress.
- The main stress may appear on the first syllable ( X . ) or the second syllable ( . X ).
- In IPA, stress is marked with the symbol / ˈ / before the stressed syllable.
  EXAMPLES: purˈsuit, ˈpurchase, comˈplete, ˈcommon.

> Drill listen to X. .X examples `Chapter-2-2.15.mp3`

### Wh- Questions | Intonation
- When we ask for new information, we normally use falling ↘ intonation.
- When we already know the answer to a question, we use rising ↗ intonation.
- In new information questions, we normally stress the last content word.
- In repeated questions , we normally stress the question word.

> TODO listen ↘ `Chapter-2-2.18.mp3` and ↗ `Chapter-2-2.19.mp3`

### Homophones | Postscript
- Homophones are words that are pronounced identically, but spelt differently.

kɔ:t [court / caught] fɑ:ðə [father / farther] nəʊz [nose / knows] nʌn [none / nun] səʊ [sew / so] sʌn [sun / son] θru: [through / threw] wɔ: [war / wore] wɔ:n [warn / worn] weðə [weather / whether] bɪld [build / billed] wɪtʃ [which/witch]

## Chapter 3

### Plosive Consonants | Sounds
- Plosives are made by fully blocking the flow of air as it leaves the mouth.
- Sound is produced when the blocked air is released in an explosion.
- There are 6 plosive sounds in spoken English: p,b - t,d - k,g

> TODO: listen plosive sounds `Chapter-3-3.1.mp3`

- In many English accents a seventh plosive - the glottal stop is common. This
sound is covered later in the chapter.

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-3-3.2.mp3`

### ʔ vs t | Sound Comparison
- When a < t > appears at the end of a syllable followed by a consonant, it will normally be replaced with a glottal stop /ʔ/ in spoken English.
- The glottal stop is produced by stopping the flow of air in the glottis.

Examples: delightful partly shotgun catwalk cat-flap setback `Chapter-3-3.5.mp3`

Many regional accents of English use a glottal stop /ʔ/ before weak vowels (water) and at the end of words (heat). The most famous example of this is Cockney, but most other regional accents behave in a similar way.

> check 3 from Exercise 3.8

### < ed > endings | Spelling & Sound
When we add < ed > to a word (root), the following pronunciation rule applies:
- If the root ends in a voiceless consonant, the < ed > ending is pronounced /t/
  EXAMPLE: chopped
- If the root ends in a voiced consonant or a vowel, the < ed > ending is pronounced /d/
  EXAMPLES: boiled
- If the root ends in a < t > or a < d >, the ending is pronounced /ɪd/
  EXAMPLES: roasted

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-3-3.11.mp3`

> Exercise 3.12 - annoyed xid - retired xid

### 3 Syllable Words | Structure
- 3 syllable words can have the main stress on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd syllables.
- If the main stress is on the 3rd syllable, there will also be secondary stress on the 1st syllable.
- Secondary stress is marked / ˌ /. EXAMPLE: /ˌenterˈtain/

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-3-3.15.mp3`

### Yes/No Questions | Intonation
- Yes/No questions normally use rising or fall-rising intonation.
- Falling intonation in a yes/no question sounds serious, formal or concerned.

> DRILL: Practice a) Rising Intonation ↗ b) Fall-rising Intonation ↘↗ c) Falling Intonation ↘

ɒ: dog, [x]thorough, wrong, [x]mother

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-4-4.4.mp3`

### /h/ | Sounds
- English contains one glottal fricative sound /h/.
- /h/ only ever appears at the beginning of a syllable.

> TODO: practice Spellings / Examples `Chapter-4-4.6.mp3`

> DRILL Preactice

### < h > in Function Words | Structure
- The following function words begin with < h >: he, her, him, have, had, has, his.
- The < h > in these function words is pronounced if the function word is unstressed and at the beginning or end of the sentence or phrase.
- This < h > will normally be silent in other positions of the sentence.
- Note that ‘have’, ‘had’ & ‘has’ also appear as content words.

> EXERCISE `Chapter-4-4.9.mp3` -> redo

### Silent Letters | Spelling & Sound
- Written English contains consonant spellings that are never pronounced.
- Consonants < b, h, k, l, n, p, s, t & w > can be silent in speech.

> [!] TODO: LISTEN DRILL `Chapter-4-4.11.mp3`

### Joining Introduction | Structure
In spoken English we aim to join words together to create smooth speech.
There are different ways words and sounds can join as follows: `Chapter-4-4.13.mp3`

**consonant + consonant joining**  
  When 2 identical sounds appear next to each other, we make one longer sound: Ball_lunch. I wish_Sharon well.

**consonant + consonant assimilation**  
Some consonant sounds can join together to form a different sound (assimilate).
Most commonly this happens to /t/, /d/ & /n/:  
  didn’t_you    t + j = tʃ  
  Anne_Ball     n + b = m  
  That_man      t + m = p  

**consonant + vowel joining**  
Final consonants move to the next syllable if the next syllable starts with a vowel:
  It _ isn’t _ always _ easy. = /ɪ tɪ zən tɔ: weɪ zi: zi/  
  Dan _ and _ Anne _ aren’t _ in. = /dæ nə næ nɑ:n tɪn/  

**vowel + vowel joining**  
If one word ends with a vowel and the next begins with a vowel, we often join the words with one of /j/ /w/ or /r/:
  you_offer (you w offer)  
  We _ entered (we j entered)  
  China _ expanded (china r expanded)  

> EXERCISE

### Prominence | Intonation
- In spoken English we give prominence (stress) to new information.
- The last word with new information will be the strongest (tonic syllable).
- We do not stress old information - “Italian food” in the example.

> DRILL

### Verb/Noun Stress Shift | Postscript
Some words are stressed differently depending on their form.
- As nouns, these words will use first syllable stress.
- As verbs, they will use second syllable stress.

## Chapter 5

### Approximant Consonants | Sounds
- An approximant is a vowel-like consonant.
- The flow of air is never fully blocked in the production of approximants.
- English contains three approximant sounds: r, j, w

> TODO: Practice r [r] - j [j,u,i] - w [w,u] `Chapter-5-5.1.mp3`

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-5-5.2.mp3`

### Lateral Approximants | Sounds
Lateral approximants are created by releasing air past the sides of the tongue.
- < l > before a vowel sound will be pronounced /l/ with the tongue tip touching the alveolar ridge. This is sometimes called ‘clear l’.
- < l > after a vowel sound will be pronounced /ɫ/ with the tongue also raised at the back of the mouth. This is sometimes called ‘dark l’.

> TODO: Practice `Chapter-5-5.3.mp3` l ɫ

> Drill: Practice `Chapter-5-5.4.mp3`

### Weak ə vs ɪ | Sound Comparison
- The most common weak vowels of English are /ə/ and /ɪ/ .
- These weak sounds are spelt using < a, e, i, o & u > in written English.
- Weak vowels can appear at the beginning, middle and end of words.

> DRILL Practice `Chapter-5-5.6.mp3` Words with /ə/ and with /ɪ/

ə: accent, thomas, fossil, [x]manage, china, evil, madness, persuade, council, [x]return, [x]harvest, Japan, [x]demand, danger, garden, [x]believe, England, parade, spoken, [x]surface
ɪ: erase, kitchen,  explain, orange, purchase, kisses, bandage, misses, English, lentil, wicked, defence, turning, [x]pencil

### Weak i vs ɪ | Sound Comparison
**Weak /i/**
- The long vowel /i:/ also appears in spoken English as a short, weak vowel /i/.
- It appears at the end of words spelt < y > (finally, only, early), and in pronouns ending < e > (me, she, we).

**Weak /ɪ/**
- The short vowel / ɪ / also appears in spoken English as a weak form.
- As a weak vowel it never appears at the end of a syllable: wanted, incredible, managing.
- In function words it is always spelt < i >: him, with, this

> TODO: I can not notice the difference!!

### < oo > | Spelling & Sound
- The spelling < oo > is most commonly pronounced /u:/ .
- Some words spelt with < oo > are pronounced /ʊ/ or /ʌ/
- The spelling < oor > is pronounced /ɔ:/
- The word ‘brooch’ is pronounced /brəʊtʃ/

ʻlookʼ /lʊk/, ʻfloodʼ /flʌd/, ʻpoorʼ /pɔ:/, ʻmoonʼ /mu:n/.

> EXERCISE 33 oo works -> PRACTICE
/ʊ/  = stood, wood, book, took, [u:]roof, good, [u:]zoom, look, [u:]zoo, [u:]tooth, hook, 
/u:/ = troop, fool, food, soon, [ʊ]wool, cool, [ʊ]foot, smooth, balloon, shampoo, room 
/ʌ/  = blood, flood, [ʊ]rook, [ʊ]hood, 
/ɔ:/ = [ʊ]shook, moor, [ʊ]brook, [ʊ]cook, poor, floor, door, 

> EXERCISE Navigation -> do it after practice oo words

### Vowel + Vowel Joining | Structure
- When one word ends with a vowel sound and the next word begins with a vowel sound, we will normally join the words in speech.
- In order to join, we will add an approximant sound: /r/ /j/ or /w/.
- The joining approximant is often shown in the spelling of the first word.

1. Joining with `/w/`
If the first word ends in a rounded vowel (u, əʊ, aʊ), we join with /w/.
`who_are you`, `go_away`, `now_and then`

2. Joining with `/j/`
If the first word ends in a high vowel (i, eɪ, aɪ, ɔɪ) we join with /j/.
`we_understand`, `pay_up`,  `try_it`

3. Joining with `/r/`
If the first word ends in a neutral vowel (ə, ɜ:, ɔ:, eə, ɪə) we join with /r/.
`brother_and sister`, `war_and peace`, `law_and order`.
Words spelt with <aw> such as ‘law’, ‘saw’ etc. join with /r/.

> DRILL Exercise: practice `Chapter-5-5.16.mp3`

> EXERCISE examples `Chapter-5-5.17.mp3`

### Question Tags | Intonation
- A question tag is added to a statement to make it into a question.
- Most question tags are opposite to their statement (negative/positive or positive/negative) and use the following intonation:
  - Falling intonation, meaning “I know what I am saying is correct”.
  - Rising intonation, meaning “I am not sure, please answer”.
- Question tags are common in British English but rare in American English.

> DRILL Exercise ↘falling intonation (Chapter-5-5.20.mp3) - ↗rising intonation (Chapter-5-5.21.mp3)

> EXERCISE : ↘falling intonation to making statements, ↗rising intonation to receive a genuine
answer or make a question

### ‘have’ | Postscript
The pronunciation of ‘have’ changes depending on its usage as follows:
- content | stressed function: `/hæv/` (I have red hair | I have finished).
- function word: `/həv/`(Have the police arrived?) `/əv/`(What have you done?) `/v/`(Iʼve finished the biscuits)
- modal obligations: `/hæf/` (We have to go now)

> Listen `Chapter-5-5.25.mp3`

## Chapter 6
### Diphthong Vowels | Sounds
- A diphthong is a long vowel that moves from one mouth position to another.
- The first position in a diphthong is stronger than the second.

> TODO: practice DRIL `Chapter-6-6.3.mp3`

### Diphthongs | Sound Comparison

> Exercise: REDO

### < o > | Spelling & Sound
- The spelling `o` commonly produces `əʊ` `ʌ` `ɒ` and `u:` in pronunciation.
- Exceptions are ‘women’ /wɪmɪn/, ‘woman’ /wʊmən/ & ‘wolf’ /wʊlf/
- The spelling `ow` produces `əʊ` & `aʊ`.
- The spelling `or` usually produces `ɔ:`.

### Compounds | Structure
catfish deadline figurehead homesick lawsuit waterfall
- A compound is formed of two words.
- Compounds can be written as one word, two words separated by a hyphen, or
two separate words.
- Most compounds place stress only on the first word.

> Drill: cobweb, cupboard, doorway, eyelash, gateway, goldfish, grapefruit, windowsill, seashore, shellfish

> Exercise: ironing board, coat hanger, rocking chair, laptop, teapot, bookshelf, candlestick holder, dining table, microwave (oven), lampshade, flower pot.

### High Fall | Intonation
- A falling pattern can start from a high tone (high-fall) or a mid tone (mid-fall).
- The meaning changes radically when the different tones are used.
- A high-fall shows enthusiasm, emotion and involvement in the speaker.
- A mid-fall shows detachment, lack of interest and even boredom.
- The high-fall is very common in spoken English - see drill below.

### ‘do’ | Postscript
The verb ‘do’ has the following pronunciations in spoken English:
- The negative form (don’t) is pronounced `dəʊnt` 
- The weak function word (do) is pronounced `də`
- The stressed or content word (do) is pronounced `du:`
- The gerund form (doing) is pronounced `du:wɪŋ`
