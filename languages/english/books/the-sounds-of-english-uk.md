## Introduction
#### Consonant Types | Sound
- Consonant sounds are produced by blocking air as it leaves the mouth.
- This course shows you how to pronounce all 25 consonant sounds of English.

> TODO: copy table

#### Consonant Articulation | Sound
- We use the articulators: tongue, lips & teeth, to block air.
- The places where we block air in English are shown below.

Exercise
1. f / v
2. t / d / l / n
3. m / p / b
4. k / g / ŋ
5. θ / ð
6. h / ʔ

#### Vowels | Sounds
- A neutral English accent has 19 vowel sounds.
- There are 3 types of English vowel sound - short, long and diphthong.
- English spelling does not always show us which sound to pronounce.

### Vowel Articulation| Sounds
- A vowel sound is made by shaping the mouth as air flows out.
- Articulators used to shape the mouth are: tongue, lips and jaw.

### Introduction | Spelling & Sound
- English spelling does not always indicate pronunciation.
- It was famously claimed that the word ‘fish’ could be spelt ‘ghoti’
- The pronunciation of many English sounds can be predicted by their spelling.
- The ‘Spelling & Sound’ section shows you how to select sounds accurately by interpreting spelling.

### Schwa | Spelling & Sound (very UK)
- The schwa sound /ə/ can be spelt as < a >, < e >, < o > and < u >.
- The schwa is the most common vowel sound in English.
- The schwa is weak - it can never be stressed.
- The production of the schwa is neutral: lips, jaw and tongue are relaxed

### Function & Content | Structure
- Spoken English is divided into function and content words.
- **Function words** carry only grammatical meaning, such as:
  - prepositions: to from for of with by
  - auxiliaries: are was do have could would shall can
  - articles: a an the
  - quantifiers: some any few all
  - pronouns: he she it you I this that
- **Content words** carry real meaning such as:
  - nouns: car wedding James table joy
  - verbs: move drink turn enjoy think
  - adjectives: big interesting quiet slow bright
  - adverbs: quickly quietly fortunately often again

[*] Pay attention to the content, not to the intonation

### Schwa Function Words | Structure
- Many function words are pronounced with schwa when they are weak.
- If a function word is stressed, it can not be pronounced with schwa.
- Function words are always strong when said alone.
to /tu:/ -> /tə/
are /ɑ:/ -> /ə/
was /wɒz/ -> /wəz/
from /frɒm/ -> /frəm/
there /ðeə/ -> /ðə/
can /kæn/ -> /kən/
her /hɜ:/ -> /hə/
for /fɔ:/ -> /fə/

### Introduction | Intonation
1. ↘Yes   ->  maybe
2. ↘↗Yes  ->  definitely
3. ↗Yes   -> why are yo uasking me?

- Spoken English uses 3 intonation patterns - fall, fall-rise & rise.
- Intonation shows us the speaker’s attitude to what they are saying.

### Usage | Intonation
- Intonation shows us a speaker’s attitude to their words.
- This course will show you how to produce English intonation in your speech.
- Some important examples of intonation usage are displayed below.

### IPA | Postscript
- IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) shows the way we pronounce words.
- In English, the pronunciation of a word often differs from its spelling, making
IPA a very useful study tool to improve your pronunciation.
- Stress is marked in IPA using the symbol **/ ˈ/**.

## Chapter 1

### Fricative Consonants | Sounds
f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ
- Fricatives are made by squeezing air between two articulators.
- There are 9 fricative consonant sounds in English (see chapter 5 for /h/):

### < th > | Sound Comparison

/θ/ is a **voiceless** sound; it is made by squeezing air past the teeth.
/ð/ is a **voiced** sound, the throat vibrates whilst air is pushed past the teeth.

#### EXERCISE th pronunciation - Chapter-1-1.4.mp3

### < s > Endings | Spelling & Sound
When we add an < s > to a word (root), the following rule applies:
- Root words ending in voiceless sounds + < s > will be pronounced /s/:
EXAMPLES: bits, shops, wants
- Root words ending in voiced sounds + < s > will be pronounced /z/:
EXAMPLES: shoes, things, ways
- Root words ending in: /s, z, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ/ + < s > will be pronounced /ɪz/:
EXAMPLES: faces, watches, cages

### Schwa | Structure
- Function words are normally weak in pronunciation.
- Many function words are pronounced with a schwa when they are weak.

### Stressed Function Words | Structure
- Function words **are not pronounced with schwa** if they are:
1. Stressed due to meaning.
EXAMPLE:
A Is that present from David?
B No, it’s *for* David!
2. At the end of the sentence/unit:
EXAMPLE:
A Who’s the present *for*?
B It’s for John.

### Sentence Stress | Intonation
- In spoken English we **stress content words**.
- **One word in every sentence** is more stressed than the others.
- Normally the **last content word** is the most stressed word.

DRILL: . x . X | a *pair* of **shoes**

### Tonic Syllable | Intonation
- **One word** carries more stress than the others in all sentences.
- This stressed word is called the **‘tonic syllable’**.
- Normally the tonic syllable is found in the **last content word** of the sentence.

### Homographs | Postscript
- Homographs are words that are spelt the same but pronounced differently.
read: /ri:d/ /red/

## Chapter 2
### Long Vowels | Sounds
- Spoken English contains 5 long vowel sounds.
- Each long vowel uses one unique position of the mouth.
- Every long vowel sound has several possible spellings.

> TODO: Exercise `Chapter-2-2.3.mp3` -> Errors with `ɜ:`

### ɪ vs i: | Sound Comparison
- There are 2 clear differences between the vowel sounds /ɪ/ and /i:/ :
  1. The position of the mouth.
  2. /i:/ is normally (though not always) longer than /ɪ/ .
- /i:/ is spelt with two vowels < ee / ei / ie / ea > in written English.
- /ɪ/ is spelt as < i > in written English (except when weak

> TODO: Listen to `Chapter-2-2.6.mp3` and `Chapter-2-2.7.mp3`

### < r > | Spelling & Sound 
:-1:
- In British English we do not pronounce every written < r >.
- If an < r > appears before a vowel sound, we pronounce it:
  EXAMPLES: rat, rice, pretty, strain, cry, story
- If an < r > appears after a vowel sound, we do not pronounce it.
  EXAMPLES: car, court, learn, shorter, store

Examples `Chapter-2-2.10.mp3`

### Two Syllable Words | Structure
- All English words of 2 syllables or more contain one main stress.
- The main stress may appear on the first syllable ( X . ) or the second syllable ( . X ).
- In IPA, stress is marked with the symbol / ˈ / before the stressed syllable.
  EXAMPLES: purˈsuit, ˈpurchase, comˈplete, ˈcommon.

> Drill listen to X. .X examples `Chapter-2-2.15.mp3`

### Wh- Questions | Intonation
- When we ask for new information, we normally use falling ↘ intonation.
- When we already know the answer to a question, we use rising ↗ intonation.
- In new information questions, we normally stress the last content word.
- In repeated questions , we normally stress the question word.

### Homophones | Postscript
- Homophones are words that are pronounced identically, but spelt differently.

kɔ:t [court / caught] fɑ:ðə [father / farther] nəʊz [nose / knows] nʌn [none / nun] səʊ [sew / so] sʌn [sun / son] θru: [through / threw] wɔ: [war / wore] wɔ:n [warn / worn] weðə [weather / whether] bɪld [build / billed] wɪtʃ [which/witch]

## Chapter 3

### Plosive Consonants | Sounds
- Plosives are made by fully blocking the flow of air as it leaves the mouth.
- Sound is produced when the blocked air is released in an explosion.
- There are 6 plosive sounds in spoken English: p,b - t,d - k,g

> TODO: listen plosive sounds `Chapter-3-3.1.mp3`

- In many English accents a seventh plosive - the glottal stop is common. This
sound is covered later in the chapter.

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-3-3.2.mp3`

### ʔ vs t | Sound Comparison
- When a < t > appears at the end of a syllable followed by a consonant, it will normally be replaced with a glottal stop /ʔ/ in spoken English.
- The glottal stop is produced by stopping the flow of air in the glottis.

Examples: delightful partly shotgun catwalk cat-flap setback `Chapter-3-3.5.mp3`

Many regional accents of English use a glottal stop /ʔ/ before weak vowels (water) and at the end of words (heat). The most famous example of this is Cockney, but most other regional accents behave in a similar way.

> check 3 from Exercise 3.8

### < ed > endings | Spelling & Sound
When we add < ed > to a word (root), the following pronunciation rule applies:
- If the root ends in a voiceless consonant, the < ed > ending is pronounced /t/
  EXAMPLE: chopped
- If the root ends in a voiced consonant or a vowel, the < ed > ending is pronounced /d/
  EXAMPLES: boiled
- If the root ends in a < t > or a < d >, the ending is pronounced /ɪd/
  EXAMPLES: roasted

> Exercise 3.12 - annoyed xid - retired xid

### 3 Syllable Words | Structure
- 3 syllable words can have the main stress on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd syllables.
- If the main stress is on the 3rd syllable, there will also be secondary stress on the 1st syllable.
- Secondary stress is marked / ˌ /. EXAMPLE: /ˌenterˈtain/

> DRILL: Practice `Chapter-3-3.15.mp3`

### Yes/No Questions | Intonation
- Yes/No questions normally use rising or fall-rising intonation.
- Falling intonation in a yes/no question sounds serious, formal or concerned.
