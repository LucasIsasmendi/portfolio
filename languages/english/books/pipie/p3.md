# Part 3 - Stress Patterns

English words can be divided into syllables. Each spoken vowel sound makes one syllable. A syllable can be:
- a vowel sound alone
- a vowel before a consonant
- a vowel after a consonant
- a vowel between consonants

## u31 - syllabes and stress
- vowel alone: ho, I
- vowel-consonant: on, ice
- consonant-vowel: to, be, you
- consonant-vowel-consonant: big, tough, cute

There are three stress levels in English: primary (/), secondary (l) and unstressed (-)

## u32.1 - two-syllable words
### primary stress
A word with two vowe lsounds has two syllables. One syllable has primary stress. Say it a little louder and longer that the other. The vowel of the unstressed syllable is usually pronounced `/É™/`, no matter how it is spelled. Make the vowel sound short. Pronounce the consonant sounds clearly and distinctly.

#### first syllable (/-)
cli-mate, ac-tor, pleas-ure, sol-dier, danc-es, wash-es, watch-es, fold-ed, seat-ed

#### second syllable (-/)
ad-vice, ex-cite, con-fused, sup-pose, sur-prised

### exceptions
The sounds `/iy/`, `/ow/`, `/iuw/`, and `/I/` often keep their normal pronunciations in unstressed syllables

#### `/iy/`
- first syllable: ar-my, ba-by, ci-ty
- second syllable: re-peat, de-duct, be-gin

#### `/ow/`
- first syllable: ar-row, el-bow, fol-low
- second syllable: o-bey, o-mit, o-kay

#### `/iuw/`
- first syllable: ar-gue, neph-ew, val-ue
- second syllable: u-nique

#### `/I/`
- first syllable: build-ing, den-tist, mu-sic
- second syllable: in-stead, in-sist, im-mune

### tip
The stress patterns `/-` and `-/` indicate the difference between certain nouns and verbs.
`/-` Nouns vs `-/` Verbs: 
`/-` pres-ent, `-/` pre-sent  
`/-` reb-el, `-/` re-bel 
`/-` ob-ject, `-/` ob-ject 
`/-` prog-ress, `-/` pro-gress 
`/-` rec-ord, `-/` re-cord

### practrice
