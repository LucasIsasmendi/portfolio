## u37 - sentence stress
When several words are spoken together in a phrase or sentece, certain words are stressed and others are spoken more softly and quickly.

### Stressed Words
Four types of words are stressed in a sentece or phrase. Say them a little louder than unstressed words.

#### 1. Most content words 
nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.
Charles Jones taught English. Shirley reads aloud every day. Aunt Janet always makes long-distance calls. Jason plays basketball.

#### 2. Interrogative words

Where's Mary's school? Why's Charlie leaving? When's Sally's party? Who's coming?

#### 3. Demostrative pronouns
this, that, these, those -> when not followed by a noun
What's this? That's Jessica's ball. Why are these here? We wanted those.

#### 4. Possessive pronouns
mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs.
That ticket's mine. This is yours. Barbara got hers. David sold his. We bought ours yesterday. They gave theirs away.

### Unstressed Words
There is no stress on most function words in a phrase or sentence. Say them quickly, but be sure to pronounce the consonants clearly. 

#### 1. articles a, an, the
Examples: a dog, an apple, the chair

#### 2. Prepositions
Such as to, from, with, in, on, through, for, by, over, under, etc.

#### 11. Modal auxiliaries

Examples: John can come. Joe has to work. Sam should leave. We would like to help. You mustn't go in the street. Kathy doesn't have to work.

#### 12. In the middle of sentence
Who, whose, when, where, why, what, how
Examples: Jenny has a cousin whose name is Smith. Do you know where she lives? Only Courtney knows why she said that. He didn't tell me when to come. I can figure out how to do it.

#### 13. short function words
and, but, or, so, not, if, as, because, wheter, since, until, though, although
Examples: Mary and Bob have plenty of food, such as sandwiches, cakes, and cookies. Joe, not John, has been here since noon. Scott was worried because his wife was so late. I'll stay until he calls, then I'll leave so you can study. Although you're sick, you can eat with Carolyn or Sue. I don't know whether he was late or not. If you eat that much, you'll be as sick as a dog.

### Exceptions
- negative modal, **can't**, is usually stressed.
- when auxiliary verbs and modal auxiliaries are not followed by a verb, they have strong stress.
Examples: She can't help him with the cooking. I'll come to the party if I can. We would lend you the car if we could. Carol has a new car, but Margaret doesn't. He doesn't know I'm unhappy, but I am.
