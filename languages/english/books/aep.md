## Tools for Learning
English is not a phonetic language (no relation between letters and sounds). Rather than relying on a letter to represent a sound, experts have come up with a unique symbol for each sound: IPA.

**IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)**

### v04 - Test Yourself
[v04](http://engl.io/aam)

PRACTICE!!!

> Practice with the audio files many times.
> Practice a concept 10-20 minutes a day
> Be patient with yourself

ɑ	ɔ	ɛ	i	I	æ	ʌ	ə	ʊ	ʒ	u

## 1. Getting Started: Placement
**Everything you do in the rest of this book should build on what you worked on here.** Do the exercises several times

### Imitation
To begin, we’re just going to imitate vocal sounds.
1. to practice and improve imitation skills.
2. to practice and get comfortable with making new kinds of sounds.
- [a1.1](http://engl.io/ab1) Try to repeat everything exactly like you hear it.

### Placement
Placement affects the overall timbre or quality of a sound. flute vs violin
- [v1.1 - Path of the Voice](http://engl.io/ab7) Speak with the body, not with your face. The body is the fuel of the voice. Exercise. English sound from chest. Connect with the abdomen
- [v1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abf) can affect the quality of a vowel: `a`-mouth `ʌ`-chest. Play around with the vibration, not changing the pitch, only the placement nose-mouth-chest with the throat. 
- [a1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abt): feel your voice in different parts of your body. Let the voice rest low, resonance in the chest, through relaxation. Never try to force your voice down. Exercise: chest, throat, mouth, nose, top of head with, neck, with a-i-r-etc

### Relaxation
#### [v1.3 - Neck and Throat](http://engl.io/abm)
To find the UH sound [ʌ], which we consider the core sound of American English, we often suggest finding a chest resonance, or a lower resonance, to help them find this sound.
Exercises: strech and relaxation of neck and shoulders, move head around

#### [v1.4 - Jaw](http://engl.io/ab2)
Exercises: 
- easily massaging the jaw with your fingertips
- start to yawn more, both vertically and horizontally
- more relax with the palm
-  a <-> u <-> ɔ
- do this when you feel tension

#### [v1.5 - Tongue](http://engl.io/ab9)
Exercises:
- tongue vs. pinky war
- clean hands, massage yout tongue
- relaxed, to pointed, to relaxed, without tensing the rest of the face
- tongue push outs
- circle the tongue around the mouth in both directions (10 times each)
- sake the tongue

Practice articulations
- [tI]*20
- [ta]*20
So, that’s using the unvoiced T sound. Now let’s try the voiced D sound.
- [di]*20
- [da]*20
- [ti ka] Trumpet players call this “double tonguing”

#### [v1.6 - Lip](http://engl.io/abx)
Exercises:
- massage
- blow
- vibration
- vibration with voice
- fish face
- shake head

Practice articulations
- i u
- u ɔ
- u i u ɔ

#### [v1.7 - Soft Palate](http://engl.io/abr)
There are only three sounds in English that are nasal, with a lowered soft palate. They are N[n], M[m], and NG[ŋ].
Examples words ON[an], SONG[sɔŋ]
Switch back and forth between AH and NG to feel your soft palate.
Get used to the idea of keeping your soft palate raised in all vowel sounds and most consonant sounds in American English (avoid nasal sounds)

## 2. Introduction to Stress, Rhythm, and Intonation
> Sounds don’t matter the most—character matters the most. The character is based on the placement, rhythm, and melody. We will get to the sounds, but first lay the foundation. It is your best chance at successfully transforming your spoken English.

In some languages, all syllables are the same length. In English, we have long (stressed) and short (unstressed) syllables.

### [v2.1 - A Stress-Timed Language](http://engl.io/ac2)

English is a `stress-timed language`. That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.
Many languages, however, are `syllable-timed`, which means each syllable has the same length.  Examples of syllable-timed languages:  French, Spanish, Cantonese. 

english are used to stressed syllables, syllables that will pop out of the line because they’re longer and they have more shape. Those are the `content words`.
Function words are pronounced differently: 
- to the -> `/də_ðə/`: I'm going "to the" store.
- because of -> `/kəz_ə/` => "Because of" my job.
- for -> `/fər/` => for you, for me

### Symbols
Most dictionaries will use `ˈ` to mark a syllable with primary stress, and `ˌ` to mark a syllable with secondary stress. All other syllables are unstressed.
Stressed syllables have a little curve up, then down in the voice.

### [v2.2 - Introduction to Word Stress](http://engl.io/acb)
In American English, certain words have stress within a sentence, and certain syllables have stress within a word. 

What makes a syllable stressed? It is usually higher in pitch. Also, longer in duration. 
In longer words with many syllables, there can be a primary stress and a secondary stress.

[software for analysis](www.praat.org)

### [v2.3 - The Shape of a Stressed Syllable](http://engl.io/ac4)
So the shape of a stressed syllable has the pitch gliding up and the pitch gliding down.
- hello: the change in pitch isn’t abrupt. It slides from lower to higher and lower again.
- download: DA-da, 

> Stress is much more than a change in pitch, it’s how you change the pitch.

### Listen + Repeat: Rhythmic Patterns.  
- [a2.2 — Rhythmic Patterns](engl.io/ac6)
- [a2.3 — Identify the Rhythmic Pattern](engl.io/ac7)

### Note
ACCENT and STRESS mean the same thing. A stressed syllable is the same as an accented syllable, an unstressed syllable is the same as an unaccented syllable.

## 3. Vowels
We’ve gotten to the point where we can put it all together—placement, rhythm, and the sounds: vowels.
There are eleven vowels in American English.

### [a3.1 — Vowels](engl.io/ad1)
ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, æ, ɛ, i, ɪ, u, ʊ, ә, ɜ

- `stressed` In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up then down. ⤵️
- `unstressed`: In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch, more relax, and a little quieter and quicker ➖

### `ʌ`
This is a very relaxed sound. Because there is no tension, the placement—resonance—is low, at the base of the neck and very upper chest.
You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz]
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-əәl]
- u: up [ʌp]

#### [v3.1 `ʌ` — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel](engl.io/ad4)
- stuff [stʌf]: `stressed` ⤵️
- undo [ʌn'du]: `unstressed` ➖

Notice the jaw may drop a bit more for a stressed syllable.

#### a3.2 — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel.
Listen + Repeat.
- sounds in `stressed syllables` are longer, louder, have an up/down shape (intonation, or melody) in the voice, use the full voice. These 
- sounds in `unstressed syllables` are shorter, flatter in pitch, quieter, and don’t use the whole voice (less air is being used). 
- If any of this is still unclear or confusing, work with Chapter Two again.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz] 
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-əәl]
- u: up [ʌp]

### `ɑ` 
like ʌ but with tension in the tongue.
The jaw drops some for this sound, and the tongue presses down in the back while the tip stays forward. Because of this tension in the tongue, the placement lifts a little bit. Though still connected to the chest, the resonance is more in the open space of the mouth. The lips are relaxed. Like all vowels, the soft palate is lifted to close the passage to the nasal cavity, letting no air through.

#### [v3.2 `ɑ` — The AH as in FATHER [ɑ] Vowel](engl.io/ada)
- job [dʒɑb]: `stressed` ⤵️ 
- blockade [blɑ'keid]: `unstressed` ➖

#### [a3.4 - Listen + Repeat: AH [ɑ] vs. UH [ʌ]](engl.io/adh)
Listen to this file 10-20 times a day without trying to repeat.
- ah [ɑ], uh [ʌ]
- shot [ʃɑt], shut [ʃʌt]
- gone [gɑn]*, gun [gʌn]
- boss [bɑs], bus [bʌs]
- crossed [kɹɑst]*, crust [kɹʌst]

#### [a3.5 — Test Yourself: AH [ɑ] vs. UH [ʌ] Test](engl.io/adk)
Listen to the minimal pairs over and over, 10 minutes a day, everyday.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: father [ˈfɑ-ðəәɹ]
- aa: bazaar [bəәˈzɑɹ]
- e: sergeant [ˈsɑɹ-dʒəәnt]
- ea: heart [hɑɹt]
- ou: cough [kɑf]
- o: body [ˈbɑd-i]

### `ɔ`
the tongue lifts up and shifts back. The lips come forward, flaring a bit. To aid this, you can think of pushing the corners of the lips away from the face. Feel the cheeks come in a little bit. The resonance is in the middle of the mouth.

#### [v3.4 — The AW as in LAW [ɔ] Vowel](engl.io/adm)
- `stressed` ⤵️ : saw [sɔ], boss[bɔs], long [lɔŋ], login [ˈlɔgˌɪn], wrong [ɹɔŋ], daughter [ˈdɔ-dəɹ]
- `unstressed` ➖: on [ɔn], runoff [ˈrʌnˌɔf], lifelong [ˈlaɪfˌlɔŋ]. Jaw drops less, the lips are more relaxed, and the tongue doesn’t shift back as much.
- it can be affected by `R`, The lips flare more, and the tongue pulls back more, and up a little bit: core[cɔɹ], sore[sɔɹ]

#### [a3.6 - Listen + Repeat: The AW as in LAW [ɔ] Vowel](engl.io/adp)
- ⤵️:aw [ɔ], saw [sɔ], along [əәˈlɔŋ], wrong [ɹɔŋ]
- ➖:aw [ɔ], recall [ˈɹi kɔl] (noun — the verb is [ɹɪˈkɔl]!), runoff [ˈɹʌn ɔf]

#### How to Pronounce Quarter
quarter in dictionary is [ˈkwɔɹ-dɜɹ], but americans pronunciate [ˈkɔɹ-dɜɹ]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: fall [fɔl]
- au: cause [kɔz]
- augh: daughter [ˈdɔd-əәɹ]
- aw: shawl [ʃɔl]
- ough: thought [θɔt]

### `æ`
jaw drops quite a bit. The tongue tip stays forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth. The back part of the tongue stretches up. Slightly lift the top lip

#### [v3.6 — The AA as in BAT [æ] Vowel](engl.io/adv)
This is a sound that changes depending on the following sound.
You can see the tongue, bacause is high in the back and low in the front, not as in `ɑ` sound. You can also see the corners of the mouth pull back and up a little bit.

- ⤵️➖: backtrack ['bækˌtɹæk]
- ⤵️: chapter['tʃæp-təɹ], can[kæn], act[ækt], last[læst], bank[bæŋk]
- ➖: baypass['baɪˌpæs]

- [æ] + [m] or [n] = the tongue relaxes in the back, making an UH sound after AA. AA-UH. It’s not a pure AA sound. The jar is no so open. The corners of the mouth do not come back and up as much. The tongue position is the same. Example: exam[ig'zæm], man[mæn], hand. [æ]+[n] = `æʌ` or `æə`
- [æ] + [ŋ] = ay[eɪ]. Example: gang[gæŋ]

#### [a3.8 - AH [ɑ] vs. AA [æ]](engl.io/ae4)
The back of the tongue presses down for [ɑ] and lifts for [æ]: ah [ɑ], aa [æ] - top [tɑp], tap [tæp] - mop [mɑp], map [mæp] - hot [hɑt], hat [hæt] - sock [sɑk], sack [sæk]

#### [a3.9 -AH [ɑ] vs. AA [æ] Test](engl.io/ae7)
Listen several times: 
1. [ɑ] or [æ]
2. bomb [ɑ] or bam [æ] 
3. bog [ɑ] or bag [æ]

- `n-m`: HAcer el a original y mover con el sonido a una a mas cerrada: e-a
- `ŋ`: eɪ
- the API is not a perfect tool, does not capture everything

#### [a3.12 - Listen + Repeat: AA [æ] vs. EH [ɛ]](engl.io/aek)
#### [a3.13 - Test Yourself: EH [ɛ] vs. AA [æ] Test](engl.io/aen)
1.[æ], 2.had [æ], 3.leapt [ɛ], 4.guess [ɛ], 5.cattle [æ]

- ai: said [sɛd]
- ay: says [sɛz]
- ea: head [hɛd]
- e: shed [ʃɛd]
- eo: leopard [ˈlɛp-əәɹd]
- ie: friend [fɹɛnd]
- u: bury [ˈbɛɹ-i]

### `i`
- `jaw`: little bit of drop
- `tongue`: tip stays behind the bottom front teeth, and the middle/front part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth. It doesn’t touch the roof of the mouth, but it is very close.
- `lips`: The corners of the lips pull a little wide, sort of like a smile—they’re not quite relaxed.
- `tension`: little jaw and tongue tension as possible.
- `resonate`: Feel the vibration between your tongue and hard palate. But, as always, keep it connected to that lower placement at the base of the neck and upper chest.

#### [v3.12 — The EE as in SHE [i] Vowel](engl.io/aer)
- ⤵️: please[pliz], keep[kip], police[pәˈlis], meet[mit], each[itʃ]
- ➖: busy[ˈbɪz-i], early[ˈɜɹ-li], coffee[ˈkɔ-fi]. More relax, no time to make full mouth position

#### [a3.14 - Listen + Repeat: The EE as in SHE [i] Vowel](engl.io/aet)
You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- ay: quay [ki]
- ea: heat [hit]
- e: be [bi]
- ee: weep [wip]
- ei: receive [ɹɪˈsiv]
- eo: people [ˈpi pəәl]
- ey: key [ki]
- ie: brief [bɹif]
- i: police [pəәˈlis]

### `ɪ` 
- `jaw`: drops a bit more than for the EE as in SHE [i], which means the arch of the tongue isn’t as close to the roof of the mouth. 
- `tongue`: tongue tip is forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth, and the front/mid part lifts up towards the roof of the mouth.
- `lips`: lips and the corners of the lips, stay relaxed.
- `placement`: For the EE as in SHE vowel, the vibration is along the front half of the hard palate. For the IH as in SIT [ɪ] vowel, it’s more in the middle of the mouth.

Tip: start with the EE as in SHE [i] vowel, then create a little more space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth by dropping your jaw just a bit more.

#### [v3.13 - The IH as in SIT Vowel](engl.io/aex)
- ⤵️: fix [fɪks]
- ➖: office [ˈɔ-fɪs]

#### [a3.15 - Listen + Repeat: The IH as in SIT [ɪ] Vowel](engl.io/aez)

#### [v3.14 - EE [i] vs. IH [ɪ]](engl.io/af2)
Remember for the EE [i](she) vowel, the tongue is very close to the roof of the mouth and the corners of the lips pull wide. For the IH [ɪ](sit) vowel, the lips are relaxed and the jaw drops a little more, allowing a little more space between the arch of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. 

Minimal pairs: it[ɪt], eat[it] - rich [ɹɪtʃ], reach [ɹitʃ] - living [ˈlɪv-ɪŋ], leaving [ˈliv-ɪŋ] - fist [fɪst], feast [fist] - ship [ʃɪp], sheep [ʃip] - tick[tɪk], teak[tik] - lip[lɪp], leap[lip] - snicker[ˈsnɪk-əɹ], sneaker[ˈsnik-əɹ]

#### [v3.15 - EE, IH, and Vowel Length](engl.io/af3)
don’t think about the length of the vowel being tied to the vowel itself. It’s tied to the syllable, and the sentence position, and maybe the ending consonant.
cap, cab - beat[bit], bid[bɪd] -  

#### [v3.16 - Beach vs. Bitch]
- good words: [i] beach, sheet. Tongue tip is down, and the front part of the tongue is lifting, very close to the roof of the mouth EE
- bad words: [ɪ] bitch, shit. More space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth. IH

#### [a3.16 - Listen + Repeat: IH [ɪ] vs. EE [i]](engl.io/af8)
Stressed: ih [ɪ], ee [i] - bin [bɪn], bean [bin] - fist [fɪst], feast [fist] - rich [ɹɪʧ], reach [ɹiʧ] - ship [ʃɪp], sheep [ʃip]

#### [a3.17 - Test Yourself: IH [ɪ] vs. EE [i] Test](engl.io/afb)
4/5 - failed #4

**TIP**: Avoid to make the EH as in BED [ɛ] instead of the IH as in SIT [ɪ], try dropping your jaw a little less, and lift your tongue more in the front.
- bean[i] bid[I] bed[ɛ]

#### [a3.18 - Listen + Repeat: EH [ɛ] vs. IH [ɪ]](engl.io/afc)
Stressed: eh [ɛ], ih [ɪ] - when [wɛn], win [wɪn] - ten [tɛn], tin [tɪn] - bed [bɛd], bid [bɪd] - mess [mɛs], miss [mɪs]

#### [a3.19 - EH [ɛ] vs. IH [ɪ] Test](engl.io/aff)
4/5 - failed #1

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- a: private [ˈpɹaɪ vɪt]
- e: pretty [prɪd i]
- ee: been [bɪn]
- i: him [hɪm]
- ui: build [bɪld]
- o: women [ˈwɪm-ɪn]
- u: minute [ˈmɪn-ɪt]
- y: symbol [ˈsɪm bəәl]

### `u`
This vowel sounds really American when it’s more about the movement into the position than the position itself.

- `lips`: start relaxed, then round. This movement is important
- `tongue`: tip stays forward, and the back part lifts.
- `placement`: middle of the mouth

#### [v3.17 - The OO as in BOO [u] Vowel](engl.io/afh)
- ⤵️: do[du], blu[blu], suit[sut], move[muv], two[tu]
- ➖: visual[ˈvɪʒ-u-әl], issue[ˈɪʃ-u], influence[ˈɪn-flu-әns]

#### [a3.20 - Listen + Repeat: The OO as in BOO [u] Vowel](engl.io/afk)
- ⤵️: oo[u], stupid[ˈstu-pɪd], shoes[ʃuz]
- ➖: oo[u], argue [ˈɑɹ-gju]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- eu: sleuth [sluθ]
- ew: blew [blu]
- o: do [du]
- oe: shoe [ʃu]
- oo: too [tu]
- ou: you [ju]
- ough: through [θɹu]
- u: flute [flut]
- ue: blue [blu]
- ui: juice [dʒus]
- wo: two [tu]

### `ʊ` 
- `tongue`: lifts in the back, towards the soft palate. Tip pulls slightly back so it’s not quite touching the back of the bottom front teeth.
- `lips`: aren’t completely relaxed: the corners of the mouth come in a little so the lips flare and push away from the face.

#### [v3.18 - The UH as in PUSH [ʊ] Vowel](engl.io/afm)
- ⤵️: took [tʊk], could [kʊd], book [bʊk], sugar[ˈʃʊg-әɹ], woman[ˈwʊm-әn],  looking [ˈlʊk ɪŋ], stood [stʊd]
- ➖: goodbye [gʊdˈbaɪ], firewood [ˈfaɪərˌwʊd], childhood [ˈʧaɪld-hʊd]

#### [a3.21 - Listen + Repeat: The UH as in PUSH [ʊ] Vowel](engl.io/afp)

#### [a3.22 - Listen + Repeat: UH [ʊ] vs. OO [u]](engl.io/afs)
OO as in BOO [u] vowel vs UH as in PUSH [ʊ] vowel. The lips round much less for UH[ʊ] than for OO[u]. Relax your lips more for the first sound, then round them more for the second.

Minimal pairs: uh[ʊ], oo[u] - stood[stʊ], stewed[stud] - pull[pʊl], pool[pul] - look[lʊk], Luke[luk] - soot[sʊt], suit[sut]

#### [a3.23 - UH [ʊ] vs. OO [u] Test](engl.io/afvs)
1/5

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- o: wolf [wʊlf]
- oo: wood [wʊd]
- ou: could [kʊd]
- u: sugar [ˈʃʊg-әɹ]

### `ə`
Knows as **schwa sound**: is only in unstressed syllables
- `lips`: part but there’s almost no jaw drop
- `tongue`: relaxed, low in the mouth, with the tip forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth
- `placement`: in the upper chest.

#### [v3.19 - The UH as in SUPPLY [əә] (Schwa) Vowel](engl.io/afx)
The schwa goes with the syllabic consonants L[əl], M[əl], N[əl], and R[əl]. That means when you have a syllable with a schwa followed by one of these consonants, you don’t need to make the schwa. It gets absorbed by the next sound.

- ➖: sofa[ˈsoʊ-fə], ability[əˈbɪl-ɪ-di], allow[əˈlaʊ], extra[ˈɛk-stɹə], data[ˈdeɪ-də], again[əˈgɛn], visa[ˈvi-zə], about[əˈbaʊt]

#### [a3.24 - Listen + Repeat: UH as in SUPPLY [əә] (Schwa)](engl.io/ag1)
- China [ˈʧaɪ-nә]

#### [a3.25 - Listen + Repeat:  Syllabic Consonants](engl.io/ag3)
The schwa is different when it’s followed by an M[m], N[N], L[l], or R[ɹ] sound. These are called syllabic consonants, which means they take over the whole syllable: you don’t need to make a schwa sound at all.
Examples: 
- system[ˈsɪs-tәm] — go straight from the T to the M. 
- open [ˈoʊp-әn] — go straight from the P to the N.
- pencil [ˈpɛn-sәl] — go straight from the S to the Dark L.
- mother [ˈmʌð-әɹ] — go straight from the TH to the R.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- a: about [əˈbaʊt]
- ea: ocean [ˈoʊ-ʃәn]
- e: anthem [ˈæn-θәm]
- eu: chauffeur (verb) [ˈʃoʊ-fәɹ]
- i: possible [ˈpɑs-ә-bəl]
- o: bottom [ˈbɑd-әm]
- ou: jealous [ˈdʒɛl-әs]
- u: autumn [ˈɔ-dәm]
- y: syringe [sәˈɹɪndʒ]

### `ɜ`
It’s basically the R consonant acting like a vowel.
The most common mistake with this sound is not lifting the tongue enough.
- `tongue`: It should be quite high in the mouth, pulled back and up so the tip isn’t touching anything.
- `lips`: corners come in so the lips can flare and push away from the face.
- `placement`: Feel the vibration in the front of the mouth, between the front of the tongue and the roof of the mouth

#### [v3.20 - The UR as in BIRD Vowel](engl.io/ag5)
- ⤵️: hurt[hɜɹt], earth[ɜɹθ], search[sɜɹʧ], circle[ˈsɜɹ-kəl], return[ɹɜˈtɜɹn]
- ➖: research[ˈri-sɜɹʧ], thirteen[θɜɹˈtin], outburst[ˈaʊt|-bɜɹst]

#### [a3.26 - Listen + Repeat: UR as in BIRD [ɜ]](engl.io/ag8)
- ⤵️: ur[ɜɹ], bird[bɜɹd], early[ˈɜɹ-li], nurse[nɜɹs]
- ➖: ur[ɜɹ], research[ˈri-sɜɹʧ], thirteen [θɜɹˈtin]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- ea: learn [lɜɹn]
- eu: chauffeur [ʃoʊˈfɜɹ] (noun)
- i: bird [bɜɹd]
- ou: journey [ˈdʒɜɹ-ni]
- o: word [wɜɹd]
- u: burn [bɜɹn]
- y: myrtle [ˈmɜɹ-dәl]

### American vs. British English - Vowels

## 4. Diphthongs
A diphthong is two vowel sounds together.
The mouth position matters: what defines the diphthong is that there are two different sounds. This means there has to be a movement, going from a starting position to an ending position.

### [a4.1 - Diphthongs](engl.io/aha)
[oʊ](#oʊ), [aʊ](#aʊ), [aɪ](#aɪ), [eɪ](#eɪ), [ɔɪ](#ɔɪ), [ju](#ju)

### `oʊ`
- `jaw`: drops for the beginning position, relax up for the ending position
- `lips`: might round some for the beginning position, but round even more for the ending position
- `tongue`: shifts back a little bit at the beginning, and the back lifts in the ending position. The back is more lifted here than in the pure [ʊ] (‘push’ [pʊʃ]).

#### [v4.1 - OH as in NO [oʊ] Diphthong](engl.io/ahd)
- sample words: lonely[ˈloʊn-li], owner[ˈoʊ-nəɹ], thelephone[ˈtɛl-ə-ˌfoʊn] [oʊ]
- sample sentence: The window of the hotel was blown out and broken[ðə-ˈwin-doʊ-ʌv-ðə-hoʊ-ˈtɛl-wɜz-bloʊn-aʊt-ænd|ˈbɹoʊ-kən].

#### [a4.2 - OH as in NO [oʊ] Diphthong](engl.io/ahf)
If you don’t round their lips enough, this diphthong can sound like the AW as in LAW [ɔ] or AH as in FATHER [ɑ] vowel instead. Remember, it’s the movement of rounding the lips that defines this diphthong. Exaggerate it a little bit.
- ⤵️: oh[oʊ], go[goʊ], know[noʊ], below[bɪˈloʊ]
- ➖: oh[oʊ], borrow[ˈbɑɹ-oʊ], yellow[ˈjɛl-oʊ]

#### [a4.3 - OH [oʊ] vs. AW [ɔ] or AH [ɑ]](engl.io/ahg)

- oa: oat [oʊt]
- oe: foe [foʊ]
- ough: though [ðoʊ]
- au: chauffeur [ˈʃoʊ-fәɹ]
- eau: beau [boʊ]

### `aʊ`
The beginning position of this diphthong, [a], is not a vowel in AmEng
- `jaw`: drop for beginning, relax for end
- `lips`: should not round at all for the beginning of this sound. Shape of the mouth as a rectangle rather than a circle. Round for the ending position
- `tongue`: wide and flat for beginning, touch front teeth, and lifting the back for ending.

#### [v4.2 - OW as in NOW [aʊ] Diphthong](engl.io/ahm)
- sample words: cow[kaʊ], bow[baʊ], sound[saʊnd]
- sample sentence: I found my flowers dead and brown when I came back to town [aɪ_faʊnd_maɪ_ˈflaʊ-əɹz_dɜd_ænd_braʊn_wɛn~aɪ_keɪm_bæk_tə_taʊn]

#### [a4.5 - Listen + Repeat - OW as in NOW [aʊ]](engl.io/ahp)
- ⤵️: ow[aʊ], now[naʊ], sound[saʊnd], power[ˈpaʊ-əәɹ]
- ➖: ow[aʊ], letdown[ˈlɛt│-daʊn], blackout[ˈblæk-aʊt]

#### [a4.6 - Listen + Repeat -  OW[aʊ] vs. AW[ɔ] or AH[ɑ]](engl.io/ahr)
Just like the OH[oʊ] diphthong, it can sound like the AW as in LAW[ɔ] or AH as in FATHER[ɑ] vowel instead when you don’t round your lips.
Remember, the OW [aʊ] diphthong is made by a movement, you must round your lips to get the right sound.
Work with these minimal pairs and take your time rounding your lips. Exaggerate it a little bit.
- ow[aʊ], aw[ɔ]
- down[daʊn], dawn[dɔn]
- pound[paʊnd], pond[pɑnd]
- mouse[maʊs], moss[mɔs]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- ou: round[ɹaʊnd]
- ow: cow[kaʊ]
- ough: bough[baʊ]

## 5. Consonants
there is no stressed and unstressed versions, because the shape and length of a syllable generally comes from the vowel or diphthong sound, not the consonants.

One consonant can represent various sounds, and you have to learn the pronunciation of each word as you learn the word.

Consonants fall into two categories, 🔈`voiced` and 🔇`unvoiced`

### [a5.1 - Paired Consonants](engl.io/ak4)
Paired Consonants (🔈`voiced` | 🔇`unvoiced`):
- 🔈 B[b] | 🔇 P[b]
- 🔈 G[g] | 🔇 K[k]
- 🔈 D[d] | 🔇 T[t]
- 🔈 V[v] | 🔇 F[f]
- 🔈 Z[z] | 🔇 S[s]
- 🔈 ZH[ʒ] | 🔇 SH[ʃ]
- 🔈 TH[ð] | 🔇 TH[θ]
- 🔈 J[dʒ] | 🔇 CH[tʃ]

### [a5.2 - Unpaired Consonants](engl.io/ak7)
The rest of the consonants are unpaired. That means they have a unique mouth position. 
- 🔇`unvoiced`: H[h]
- 🔈`voiced`: M[m], N[n], NG[ŋ], Y[j], W[w], R[ɹ], ligh L[l], dark L[l] (nasal), with the vocal cords buzzing with the sound.

**Section 1: Paired Consonants**

### `b-p`
Stop consonants: stop happens when the lips close
- `jaw`: drop a little
- `lips`: remain closed
- `tongue`: forward

#### [v5.2 - B[b] and P[p] Consonants](engl.io/ak8)
- sample words: pad[pæd|], bad[bæd|], pot[pɑt|], bought[bɔt|]
- sample sentence: Pick a big print for the bedspread [pɪk~ə_bɪg|_pɹɪnt|_fəɹ_ðə_ˈbɛd|spɹɛd]

When the B or P is at the end of a sentence, the release will be dropped, or the release will be light

#### [v5.3 - Stop Consonants](engl.io/aka)
The definition of a stop consonant has three parts
1. tongue or the lips close off the air flow entirely.
2. build up of pressure
3. release

There are 6 different stop consonants: 
- close by lips: [p-b]
- close by tongue: [t-d]
- close by tongue back: [k-g]

IPA rachel symbol for release in a stop consonant is not pronunced: `|`. Examples: stop[stɑp|], wait[weɪt|]

#### [a5.3 - Listen + Repeat - B[b] and P[p]](engl.io/akd)
- ▶️: b[b], p[p], put[pʊt], boss[bɔs], shopping[ˈʃɑp-ɪŋ], subway[ˈsʌb-weɪ], stop[stɑp]
- ⏹️: job[ʤɑb│]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- b: bought [bɔt]
- bb: wobble [ˈwɑb əәl]
- p: put [pʊt]
- pp: happy [ˈhæp i]
- gh: hiccough [ˈhɪk ʌp] (this is an unusual spelling, it’s usually spelled ‘hiccup’)

### `g-k`
- `tongue`: lifting the back, touches the soft palate, then pulling down to release the tongue and the air. Tongue tip: do not affect this sound
- `jaw`: drop a little
- `lips`: do not affect this sound. They can take the shape of the next sound

The G[g] sound is `voiced` 🔈, and the K[k] sound is `unvoiced` 🔇.
These consonants are stop consonants. Sometimes you’ll hear a stop, and sometimes you’ll hear a light release.

#### [v5.4 - G[g] and K[k] Consonants](engl.io/akf)
- Sample words: cap[kæp]/gap[gæp], curl[kɜɹl]/girl[gɜɹl], kill[kɪl]/gill[kɪl]
- Sample sentence: Chris carried the gray crate to the gate [kɹɪs_ˈkeɪɹ-id_ðə_gɹeɪ_kɹeɪt_tə_ðə_geɪt]

#### [a5.4 - Listen + Repeat - G[g] and K[k]](engl.io/akh)
- ▶️: gg[g], kk[k], click[klɪk], dog[dɔg]
- ⏩: cut[kʌt], go[goʊ], location[loʊˈkeɪ-ʃəәn], ugly[ˈʌg-li]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. [g]
- g: go [goʊ]
- gg: wiggle [ˈwɪg əәl]
[k]
- c: can [kæn]
- cc: occur [əәˈkɜɹ]
- k: skip [skɪp]
- ck: tick [tɪk]
- ch: character [ˈkæɹ ɪk təәɹ]
- x: extra [ˈεk stɹəә]
- q: quite [kwaɪt]

### `t-d`
T is one of the hardest consonants because there is more than one pronunciation.
First, let me clarify that we’re talking about the sounds [t] and [d], not the letters T and D.

#### [v5.5 - Contractversation](engl.io/akj)
- going to -> to[də]
- Do you -> [djə]
- want to -> wanna
- thank you -> thanks
- I have -> I've
- got to -> [gɑt|tu]
- get done -> [gɛt|dʌn]
- I will -> I'll[ɔl]
- I would -> I'd
- That will -> that'll[ˈðæd-əl]
- you -> [jə]

**Ways to pronounce [t]**
#### (1) Stop T [t│] 
- When the next sound is a consonant: cutback [ˈkʌt│ˌbæk], put my [pʊt│_mɑɪ]
- At the end of a thought or sentence: I knew that. [ɑɪ_ˈnu_ðæt│]. Neat. [nit│]
- In the T-schwa-N sequence: important [ɪmˈpɔɹ-t│ənt│], mountain[ˈmaʊn-t│ən]

The Stop T is made when you stop the air and don’t release it before starting the next sound (skipping the release).
You leave your tongue tip down, middle tongue stop de air.
It changes the vocal shape of the word, end more abruptly. The melody shape isn’t as curved.

##### [a5.5 - Listen + Repeat - Stop T vs. No T](engl.io/akm)
Words without the stop T go down in pitch at the end. Words with the Stop T end more abruptly.
- way [weɪ] — wait [weɪt│]
- bay [beɪ] — bait [beɪt│]
- day [deɪ] — date [deɪt│]
- fee [fi] — feet [fit│]
- she [ʃi] — sheet [ʃit│]
- pow [paʊ]— pout [paʊt│]

#### (2) Flap T [d]
- When the T comes between vowel sounds: pretty [ˈpɹɪd-i]
about it [əәˈbaʊd‿ɪt│]
- When the T comes after an R before a vowel sound: party [ˈpɑɹ-di], sort of [ˈsɔɹd‿əv]

It sounds like the R [ɾ] in Spanish (caro). Not the American R [ɹ].
The very front of tongue bounces against the roof of the mouth quickly. The air does not stop, the word flows

##### [v5.6 - The Flap T like in PARTY](engl.io/akp)
Flap T after R, before a vowel.
- example words: alerted[ə-ˈlɜɹ-dɪd], article[ˈɑɹ-dɪ-kəl], charter[ˈtʃɑɹ-dəɹ], mortified[ˈmɔɹ-də-ˌfaɪd], sorted[ˈsɔɹ-dɪd], vertical[ˈvɜɹ-dɪ-kəl]
- example phrases: part of[ˈpɑɹ‿dəv], expert in[ˈɛk-spɜɹ‿dɪn], airport on[ˈɛəɹ-pɔɹ‿dɑn]

##### [v5.7 - The Flap T like in PRETTY](engl.io/akr)
Flap T between vowels. Not starting a stressed syllable
- example words: pretty[ˈpɹɪd-i], city[ˈsɪd-i], matter[ˈmæd-əɹ]
- example phrases: thought of[θɔd‿əv], what is it[wʌd‿ɪz‿ɪt|],

#### (3) No T at All
Drop the T sound between consonants, is not as strong of a habit for Americans as using the Flap and Stop T.
- Examples: exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li], kept my [kεp│_maɪ]
- After the N sound: internet[ˈɪn-əɹˌnεt│], wanted[ˈwɑn-ɪd]

##### [v5.8 - On the Farm](engl.io/akt)
- out: out[aʊt|], out of[aʊd‿əv], out[aʊt](depends of the situation)
- phrases: what is[wʌd‿ɪz], just said[dʒʌs‿sɛd], kind of ->'kinda'[ˈkaɪnd‿ə], out lately[aʊt|-ˈleɪt|-li], about to[ə-ˈbaʊt|-tə]
- drop T: exact[ɪɡˈzækt] -> exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li]
- true T: great[gɹeɪt]

##### [v5.9 - T and D between Consonants](engl.io/akv)
When the T and D sounds come between two other consonant sounds, many Americans will drop them.
- words: exactly[ɪgˈzæk-li], 
- links: grand piano, grand theft auto, just one[dʒʌs_wʌn](the one word is w consonant),just once, just for, must be, stand for

#### (4) True T[t]
At the beginning of a stressed syllable. In consonant clusters.
The True T is a stop consonant: 
- `step 1`: stop the air in the throat, close your teeth, and bring the tip of the tongue to the roof of your mouth, behind your front teeth. 
- `step 2`: The release is a burst of air: lower your tongue, let your teeth part, and release the air, beginning the next sound

#### [v5.10 - T and D Consonants](engl.io/akx)
- pat[pæt]
- Stop consonants are sometimes pronounced without the second part, without this release, when they come at the end of a syllable or a word. Example: I bet you did[aɪ_bɛt|‿jʊ_dɪd]
- when the T comes between two vowel sounds, it sounds like a d: madder[ˈmæd-əɹ] and matter[ˈmæd-əɹ]
- The lip position of these sounds is influenced by the sound that comes next: dime[daɪm], drain[dɹeɪn], do[du]
- example words: time[taɪm]/dime[daɪm], tad[tæd|]/dad[dæd|], tote[toʊt|]/dote[doʊt|]
- example sentence: Tom tasted Dad’s dark chocolate treats[tɑm_ˈteɪst-ɪd‿dædz_dɑɹk_ˈʧɑk-lət|‿tɹits]

Exceptions:
- into [ˈɪn-tu]: True T
- seventy [ˈsεv-әn-di] and ninety[ˈnaɪn-di]: Flap T’s
- politics [ˈpɑl-ә-tɪks]: True T

At eight[æd‿eɪt|]. An acquaintance told me[ən_ə-ˈkweɪnt|-əns_toʊld_mi]. I slept well last night[aɪ_slɛpt_wɛl‿læst_naɪt|]

#### [a5.7 — What T do you Hear?](engl.io/ang)
5/8 (pagina 94 - respuesta 261)

#### The D Sounds
- `tongue`: (1) stop the air in your throat and bring the tongue tip to the roof of the mouth. (2) Release the tongue with your voice—this is a voiced consonant—and go right into the next sound.
- `jaw`: teeth close or not

Stop T and a D that’s not released sound almost the same. With the D, however, there is a bit of a voiced sound in the throat, even in the stop.
Another tip: when two words are the same but one ending is voiced and the other unvoiced, the vowel before the voiced ending is just a little longer. So ‘hid’[hɪd│] is a little longer than ‘hit’[hɪt│], ‘buzz’ is a little bit longer than ‘bus’, and so on.

If the D comes between two vowels or diphthongs (“body”), or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong (“hardy”), the air doesn’t stop. These are the same rules for the Flap T, and it sounds just like the Flap T.
Because the Flap T and the D between vowel sounds the same, these words sound the same: 
- matter[ˈmæd-əɹ] — madder[ˈmæd-әɹ]
- writer[ˈɹaɪ-dәɹ] — rider[ˈɹaɪ-dәɹ]

#### [v5.14 - Homophone Phrases](engl.io/anj)
A homophone is a pair or set of words that have different meanings and often different spellings, but sound the same, like flour/flower. The context will tell you which one is.
- [ˈgɑd-ə]: got a/got to/I’ve got to.
- [ˈlɛd-ər]: let her/lead her/letter. 
- [ˈbʌd-ər]: but her/butter
- [ˈgeɪv-əm]: gave him/gave them

#### [a5.8 - Listen + Repeat - The D [d] Consonant](engl.io/anm)
- ▶️: dd[d], need[nid] ,add[æd]
- ⏩:do[du], die[daɪ], lady[ˈleɪ-di], medicine[ˈmεd-ә-sɪn]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- t: tap[tæp]
- tt: attain[әˈteɪn]
- d: dog[dɔg]
- dd: add[æd]

### `v-f`
These consonants are ‘fricatives’, which means we pass the air through a narrow channel made by the lips, tongue, or teeth.
In this case, we bring the bottom lip up to touch the bottom of the top front teeth and pass air through this pressed space. The F[🔇] is unvoiced, and the V[🔈] is voiced.
We don’t want it to curl in, just lift. It’s the inside of the bottom lip that should touch the bottom of the top front teeth.
The lips have to be loose, without tension, so they can vibrate with the air.
hold them out for several seconds as you practice, to fine-tune your mouth position.

#### [v5.15 - V[v] and F[f] Consonants](engl.io/anp)
- Sample words 🔇[f]-🔈[v]: fan[fæn] - van[væn], fault[fɔlt] - vault[vɔlt], photo[ˈfoʊˌdoʊ] - vote[voʊt|]
- Sample sentence: They served a very fresh oven-baked flounder fillet [ðeɪ_sɜɹvd‿ə_ˈvɛ-ɹi_fɹɛʃ_ˈʌv-ən-beɪkt_ˈflaʊn-dəɹ_fɪ-ˈleɪ]

#### [a5.9 - Listen + Repeat - V[v] and F[f] Consonants](engl.io/ans)
vv[v], ff[f], fail[feɪl], vest[vεst], delivery[dɪˈlɪv-ә-ɹi], differ [ˈdɪf əәɹ], leave[liv], leaf[lif]
- The [v] at the end of ‘leave’ is weak. Not like the [v] in ‘vest’
- ‘Leaf’ is a little shorter.

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- f: fun[fʌn]
- ff: stuff[stʌf]
- ph: phone[foʊn]
- gh: laugh[læf]
- v: love[lʌv]
- vv: savvy[ˈsæv-i]

### `z-s`
These sounds are also fricatives. Here, the air passage is made narrow with the teeth. The `teeth` come together, and the `tongue` can take one of two positions. It can either point down, so it presses against the back of the bottom front teeth (that’s how I make it). Or, it can point up, where the tongue tip doesn’t touch anything, but is close to the roof of the mouth. The S is unvoiced(🔇) and the Z is voiced(🔈).

#### [v5.16 - S[s] and Z[z] Consonants](engl.io/anu)
- Sample words 🔇[s]-🔈[z]: sip[sɪp]-zip[zɪp], see[si]-zebra[ˈzi-brə], bus[bʌs]-buzz[bʌz]
- Sample sentence: Because it’s sunny and he’s fair-skinned, he has to wear sunscreen [bɪ-kʌz_ɪts‿ˈsʌn-i_ænd_hiz_fɛəɹ-skɪnd], [hi_hæs_tə_wɛəɹ_ˈsʌn-skɹin]

#### [a5.10 - Listen + Repeat - Z[z] and S[s] Consonants](engl.io/anw)
- zz[z], ss[s], sun[sʌn], zoo[zu], dressy[ˈdɹεs-i], Brazil [bɹәˈzɪl], lays[leɪz], lace[leɪs]

Spanish speakers, make a very clear S[s] sound for every S they see. But many S’s are pronounced as a Z: busy[ˈbɪz.i], business[ˈbɪz.nɪs], husband[ˈhʌz.bənd], cousin[ˈkʌz.ən], as[əz], these[ðiːz], president[ˈprɛzəˌdɛnt], always[ˈɔlˌweɪz]. You just need to learn the pronunciation of them as you learn the word.

#### [v5.17 - Letter S as the [z] Sound](engl.io/anz)
- 🔈[z]: cousin[ˈkʌz.ən], husband[ˈhʌz.bənd], because[bɪˈkɔz], bruise[bruz], is[ɪz], his[hɪz], was[wʌz], design[dɪˈzaɪn], lose[luz]
- (as a verb): use[juz]/ house[haʊz]
- (as a noun): use[jus] / house[haʊs]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English. 
- [s]
- s: sun [sʌn]
- ss: mess [mεs]
- x: extra [ˈεk stɹəә]
- cc: accept [ækˈsεpt]
- c: cell [sεl]
- sc: scent [sεnt]
- [z]
- z: zoo [zu]
- zz: buzz [bʌz]
- s: busy [ˈbɪz i]
- ss: dessert [dɪˈzɜɹt]

### `sh-zh`
These sounds are also fricatives. 
- `teeth`: come together for these sounds to constrict the air passage.
- `tongue`: tip lifts so the tip and the front part of the tongue are very close to the front part of the roof of the mouth, but not touching.
- `lips`: flare out.

SH[ʃ]is unvoiced(🔇) and ZH[ʒ] is voiced(🔈).

#### [v5.18 - SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ] Consonants](engl.io/an2)
- sample words: ship[ʃɪp], measure[ˈmɛʒ-əɹ] / dish[dɪʃ], decision[dɪ-ˈsɪʒ-ən] / wash[wɑʃ], mirage[mɪ-ˈɹɑʒ]
- Sample sentence: She made the decision to get a beige bed spread with chic striped sheets. [ʃi_meɪd|‿ðə_dɪ-ˈsɪʒ-ən_tə_gɛd‿ə_beɪʒ] [ˈbɛd|_sprɛd_wɪθ_ʃik_stɹaɪpt_ʃits]

#### [a5.11 - Listen + Repeat - SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ] Consonants](engl.io/an4)
sh[ʃ], zh[ʒ], shame[ʃeɪm], genre[ˈʒɑn-ɹә], official[əˈfɪʃ-әl], Asia[ˈeɪ-ʒә], stash[stæʃ], beige[beɪʒ]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- [ʃ]
- sh: ship [ʃɪp]
- sch: schwa [ʃwɑ]
- ti: action[ˈæk-ʃəәn]
- ci: crucial[ˈkɹu-ʃəәl]
- ssi: mission[ˈmɪʃəәn]
- s: sure [ʃʊəәɹ]
- [ʒ]
- s: usual [ˈju-ʒu-әl]
- ge: beige [beɪʒ]
- z: azure[ˈæʒ-әɹ]

### `th(θ-ð)`
These sounds are also fricatives. Here, the air passage is constricted by the tongue and the teeth. To make these sounds, the tongue tip needs to come through the teeth, just a little bit.
Students often substitute the F and V, the S and Z, or the T and D sounds. Don’t do that, get comfortable with these new sounds.

Common mistakes: aside from the substitutions, put too much of the tongue through the teeth. It should just be the tip. Also, make this a stop sound, with tension that releases. This should not be a stop, there should be a continuous flow of air. The tongue has to be relaxed for the air to flow freely.

#### [v5.19 - TH[θ-ð] Consonants](engl.io/an7)
- [θ]🔇 and [ð]🔈
- For the THR consonant cluster, the lips will begin to move into position for the R while the TH is being made: three[θriː]
- In some cases, these sounds will be replaced with a similar sound, when the tongue does not quite come through the teeth. Instead it presses against the closed teeth.  This will happen in an unstressed word only, when there isn’t enough time given to the word for teeth to part and the tongue to come through: What’s in the car?[wɒts_ɪn_ðə_kɑː?]->[wɒts_ɪn_də_kɑː?]
- sample words: thin[θɪn]/this[ðɪs], thief[θif]/these[ðiz], birthday[ˈbɜɹθ-deɪ]/worthy[ˈwɜɹ-ði]
- sample sentence:  I thought of using these Lily of the Valleys rather than those thorny roses. [aɪ_θɔt‿ʌv_ˈju-zɪŋ_ðiːz_ˈlɪ-li_ɒv_ðə_ˈvæl-iz] [ˈɹæð-əɹ_ðən_ðoʊz_ˈθoʊɹ-ni_ˈroʊz-əz]

#### [a5.12 - Listen + Repeat - Two TH [θ-ð] Consonants](engl.io/ap2)
th[θ], th[ð], think[θɪŋk], this[ðɪs], something[ˈsʌmˌθɪŋ], brother[bɹʌð-әɹ], with[wɪθ], loathe[loʊð]

These two sounds are only spelled with the letters ‘th’: - [θ]
- th: theme[θim]
- [ð]
- th: this[ðɪs]

### `ʧ-ʤ`
These sounds are stops and fricatives, combining the tongue position of T[t] and D[d] with the lip position of SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ]. 
The `tongue` tip is at the roof of the mouth, the `teeth` are together, and the `lips` flare. Because they are stop consonants, you cannot hold them out the way you can hold out SH[ʃ] and ZH[ʒ].
Stop the air in the throat with the tongue tip at the roof of the mouth, and release the air by pulling the tongue down. Unlike the stop consonants, you cannot skip the release on these words.

#### [v5.19 - CH[ʧ] and JJ[ʤ] Consonants](engl.io/ap5)
- CH[ʧ]🔇 / JJ[ʤ]🔈 
- sample words: char[ʧɑɹ] /jar[ʤɑɹ], chump[ʧʌmp] /jump[ʤʌmp]
- sample sentence: I was on the edge of my seat watching each match of the major tournament. [aɪ_wʌz‿ɒn_ði_ɛʤ‿ʌv_maɪ_sit_ˈwɒʧ-ɪŋ_iʧ] [mæʧ‿ʌv_ðə_ˈmeɪʤ-əɹ_ˈtɜɹ-nə-mənt]

#### [a5.13 - Listen + Repeat - CH[ʧ] and JJ[ʤ] Consonants](engl.io/ap8)
ch[ʧ], jj[dʒ], cheap[ʧip], job[ʤɑb], kitchen[ˈkɪʧ-әn], major[ˈmeɪ-ʤәɹ], much[mʌʧ], age [eɪʤ]

#### [a5.14 - Listen + Repeat - SH[ʃ] vs. CH[ʧ]](engl.io/apb)
- wish[wɪʃ], which[wɪʧ]
- chin[ʧɪn], shin[ʃɪn]
- batch[bæʧ], bash[bæʃ]
- ditch[dɪʧ], dish[dɪʃ]

You’ll see these sounds spelled several ways in American English.
- [ʧ]
- ch: change[ʧeɪnʤ]
- tch: match[mæʧ]
- [dʒ]
- j: jam [ʤæm]
- g: gell [ʤεl]
- dg: budget [ˈbʌʤ-ɪt]
- di: soldier [ˈsoʊl-ʤəɹ]
- dj: adjective [ˈæʤ-ɪk-tɪv]

**Section 2: Non-Paired consonants**
### `m`
The `lips` press lightly together, and likely the `jaw` will drop just a little to get ready for the next vowel or diphthong sound. You can hold this sound out continuously. When you practice, hold it for 5 seconds and feel the buzz of the voice. This is a voiced consonant.

#### [v5.21 - M[m] Consonant](engl.io/apd)
Is categorized as a nasal consonant along with N and NG[ŋ]. Air pass up over the soft palate.
- sample words: map[mæp], hammer[ˈhæm-əɹ], bottom[ˈbɒd-əm]
- sample sentence: My mom might come tomorrow morning [maɪ_mɒm‿maɪt|_kʌm_tə-ˈmɒɹ-oʊ_ˈmɔɹn-ɪŋ]

#### [a5.15 - Listen + Repeat - M[m]](engl.io/apf)
mm[m], my[maɪ], human[ˈhju-mәn], some[sʌm]

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English.
- m: man[mæn]
- mm: yummy[ˈjʌm-i]

### `ŋ`
This nasal sound is a little different from [m] and [n]: it doesn’t start any words in American English. It only comes in the middle (“singer”) or at the end of a word (“ring”). It’s made by lifting the back part of the tongue to touch the lowered soft palate. The tongue tip stays down in the front, but it might not be quite touching the back of the bottom front teeth. Jaw drop and lip position don’t affect this sound, as long as the tongue is in the right position.

Because of the -ing [ɪŋ] form of verbs, this is a very common ending sound. Except in the most casual and common phrases (What are you doing? → Whatcha doin’? [ˈwʌʧ‿əˈdo-ɪn]).

The letters ‘ng’ and the the NG [ŋ] sound can be 
- ng = [ndʒ]: change [tʃeɪndʒ], angel [ˈeɪn-ʤəl]
- ng = [ng]: unglue [ʌnˈglu], engaged [εnˈgeɪʤd]
- ng = [ŋg]: angle [ˈæŋ-gәl], English [ˈɪŋ-glɪʃ]
- nk = [ŋk]: ankle [ˈæŋ-kəl], bank [bæŋk]
- nk = [nk]: unkept [ʌnˈkεpt], unkind [ʌnˈkaɪnd] (‘un’ is a prefix)

#### [v5.21 - NG[ŋ] Consonant](engl.io/aph)
- sample words: sing[sɪŋ], think[θɪŋk], running[ˈɹʌn-ɪŋ]
- Sample sentence: Studying English and practicing speaking is rewarding. [ˈstʌd-i-ɪŋ_ˈɪŋg-lɪʃ_ænd|_ˈpræk-tɪs-ɪŋ] [ˈspik-ɪŋ_ɪz_ɹɪ-ˈwɔɹ-dɪŋ]

#### [a5.16 - Listen + Repeat - NG[ŋ]](engl.io/apk)
ng[ŋ], song[sɔŋ], English[ˈɪŋ-glɪʃ], young[jʌŋ]

You’ll see this sound spelled two ways in American English. 
- ng: thing [θɪŋ]
- n: thank [θæŋk]
