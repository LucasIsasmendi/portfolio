## Tools for Learning
English is not a phonetic language (no relation between letters and sounds). Rather than relying on a letter to represent a sound, experts have come up with a unique symbol for each sound: IPA.

**IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)**

### v04 - Test Yourself
[v04](http://engl.io/aam)

PRACTICE!!!

> Practice with the audio files many times.
> Practice a concept 10-20 minutes a day
> Be patient with yourself

ɑ	ɔ	ɛ	i	I	æ	ʌ	ə	ʊ	ʒ	u

## 1. Getting Started: Placement
**Everything you do in the rest of this book should build on what you worked on here.** Do the exercises several times

### Imitation
To begin, we’re just going to imitate vocal sounds.
1. to practice and improve imitation skills.
2. to practice and get comfortable with making new kinds of sounds.
- [a1.1](http://engl.io/ab1) Try to repeat everything exactly like you hear it.

### Placement
Placement affects the overall timbre or quality of a sound. flute vs violin
- [v1.1 - Path of the Voice](http://engl.io/ab7) Speak with the body, not with your face. The body is the fuel of the voice. Exercise. English sound from chest. Connect with the abdomen
- [v1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abf) can affect the quality of a vowel: `a`-mouth `ʌ`-chest. Play around with the vibration, not changing the pitch, only the placement nose-mouth-chest with the throat. 
- [a1.2 - Placement](http://engl.io/abt): feel your voice in different parts of your body. Let the voice rest low, resonance in the chest, through relaxation. Never try to force your voice down. Exercise: chest, throat, mouth, nose, top of head with, neck, with a-i-r-etc

### Relaxation
#### [v1.3 - Neck and Throat](http://engl.io/abm)
To find the UH sound [ʌ], which we consider the core sound of American English, we often suggest finding a chest resonance, or a lower resonance, to help them find this sound.
Exercises: strech and relaxation of neck and shoulders, move head around

#### [v1.4 - Jaw](http://engl.io/ab2)
Exercises: 
- easily massaging the jaw with your fingertips
- start to yawn more, both vertically and horizontally
- more relax with the palm
-  a <-> u <-> ɔ
- do this when you feel tension

#### [v1.5 - Tongue](http://engl.io/ab9)
Exercises:
- tongue vs. pinky war
- clean hands, massage yout tongue
- relaxed, to pointed, to relaxed, without tensing the rest of the face
- tongue push outs
- circle the tongue around the mouth in both directions (10 times each)
- sake the tongue

Practice articulations
- [tI]*20
- [ta]*20
So, that’s using the unvoiced T sound. Now let’s try the voiced D sound.
- [di]*20
- [da]*20
- [ti ka] Trumpet players call this “double tonguing”

#### [v1.6 - Lip](http://engl.io/abx)
Exercises:
- massage
- blow
- vibration
- vibration with voice
- fish face
- shake head

Practice articulations
- i u
- u ɔ
- u i u ɔ

#### [v1.7 - Soft Palate](http://engl.io/abr)
There are only three sounds in English that are nasal, with a lowered soft palate. They are N[n], M[m], and NG[ŋ].
Examples words ON[an], SONG[sɔŋ]
Switch back and forth between AH and NG to feel your soft palate.
Get used to the idea of keeping your soft palate raised in all vowel sounds and most consonant sounds in American English (avoid nasal sounds)

## 2. Introduction to Stress, Rhythm, and Intonation
> Sounds don’t matter the most—character matters the most. The character is based on the placement, rhythm, and melody. We will get to the sounds, but first lay the foundation. It is your best chance at successfully transforming your spoken English.

In some languages, all syllables are the same length. In English, we have long (stressed) and short (unstressed) syllables.

### [v2.1 - A Stress-Timed Language](http://engl.io/ac2)

English is a `stress-timed language`. That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.
Many languages, however, are `syllable-timed`, which means each syllable has the same length.  Examples of syllable-timed languages:  French, Spanish, Cantonese. 

english are used to stressed syllables, syllables that will pop out of the line because they’re longer and they have more shape. Those are the `content words`.
Function words are pronounced differently: 
- to the -> `/də_ðə/`: I'm going "to the" store.
- because of -> `/kəz_ə/` => "Because of" my job.
- for -> `/fər/` => for you, for me

### Symbols
Most dictionaries will use `ˈ` to mark a syllable with primary stress, and `ˌ` to mark a syllable with secondary stress. All other syllables are unstressed.
Stressed syllables have a little curve up, then down in the voice.

### [v2.2 - Introduction to Word Stress](http://engl.io/acb)
In American English, certain words have stress within a sentence, and certain syllables have stress within a word. 

What makes a syllable stressed? It is usually higher in pitch. Also, longer in duration. 
In longer words with many syllables, there can be a primary stress and a secondary stress.

[software for analysis](www.praat.org)

### [v2.3 - The Shape of a Stressed Syllable](http://engl.io/ac4)
So the shape of a stressed syllable has the pitch gliding up and the pitch gliding down.
- hello: the change in pitch isn’t abrupt. It slides from lower to higher and lower again.
- download: DA-da, 

> Stress is much more than a change in pitch, it’s how you change the pitch.

### Listen + Repeat: Rhythmic Patterns.  
- [a2.2 — Rhythmic Patterns](engl.io/ac6)
- [a2.3 — Identify the Rhythmic Pattern](engl.io/ac7)

### Note
ACCENT and STRESS mean the same thing. A stressed syllable is the same as an accented syllable, an unstressed syllable is the same as an unaccented syllable.

## 3. Vowels
We’ve gotten to the point where we can put it all together—placement, rhythm, and the sounds: vowels.
There are eleven vowels in American English.

### [a3.1 — Vowels](engl.io/ad1)
ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, æ, ɛ, i, ɪ, u, ʊ, əә, ɜ

- `stressed` In a stressed syllable, the vowel curves up then down. ⤵️
- `unstressed`: In an unstressed syllable, it’s lower and flatter in pitch, more relax, and a little quieter and quicker ➖

### `ʌ`
This is a very relaxed sound. Because there is no tension, the placement—resonance—is low, at the base of the neck and very upper chest.
You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz]
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-əәl]
- u: up [ʌp]

#### [v3.1 `ʌ` — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel](engl.io/ad4)
- stuff [stʌf]: `stressed` ⤵️
- undo [ʌn'du]: `unstressed` ➖

Notice the jaw may drop a bit more for a stressed syllable.

#### a3.2 — The UH as in BUTTER [ʌ] Vowel.
Listen + Repeat.
- sounds in `stressed syllables` are longer, louder, have an up/down shape (intonation, or melody) in the voice, use the full voice. These 
- sounds in `unstressed syllables` are shorter, flatter in pitch, quieter, and don’t use the whole voice (less air is being used). 
- If any of this is still unclear or confusing, work with Chapter Two again.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. 
- oe: does [dʌz] 
- o: love [lʌv]
- oo: blood [blʌd]
- ou: trouble [ˈtɹʌb-əәl]
- u: up [ʌp]

### `ɑ` 
like ʌ but with tension in the tongue.
The jaw drops some for this sound, and the tongue presses down in the back while the tip stays forward. Because of this tension in the tongue, the placement lifts a little bit. Though still connected to the chest, the resonance is more in the open space of the mouth. The lips are relaxed. Like all vowels, the soft palate is lifted to close the passage to the nasal cavity, letting no air through.

#### [v3.2 `ɑ` — The AH as in FATHER [ɑ] Vowel](engl.io/ada)
- job [dʒɑb]: `stressed` ⤵️ 
- blockade [blɑ'keid]: `unstressed` ➖

#### [a3.4 - Listen + Repeat: AH [ɑ] vs. UH [ʌ]](engl.io/adh)
Listen to this file 10-20 times a day without trying to repeat.
- ah [ɑ], uh [ʌ]
- shot [ʃɑt], shut [ʃʌt]
- gone [gɑn]*, gun [gʌn]
- boss [bɑs], bus [bʌs]
- crossed [kɹɑst]*, crust [kɹʌst]

#### [a3.5 — Test Yourself: AH [ɑ] vs. UH [ʌ] Test](engl.io/adk)
Listen to the minimal pairs over and over, 10 minutes a day, everyday.

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: father [ˈfɑ-ðəәɹ]
- aa: bazaar [bəәˈzɑɹ]
- e: sergeant [ˈsɑɹ-dʒəәnt]
- ea: heart [hɑɹt]
- ou: cough [kɑf]
- o: body [ˈbɑd-i]

### `ɔ`
the tongue lifts up and shifts back. The lips come forward, flaring a bit. To aid this, you can think of pushing the corners of the lips away from the face. Feel the cheeks come in a little bit. The resonance is in the middle of the mouth.

#### [v3.4 — The AW as in LAW [ɔ] Vowel](engl.io/adm)
- `stressed` ⤵️ : saw [sɔ], boss[bɔs], long [lɔŋ], login [ˈlɔgˌɪn], wrong [ɹɔŋ], daughter [ˈdɔ-dəɹ]
- `unstressed` ➖: on [ɔn], runoff [ˈrʌnˌɔf], lifelong [ˈlaɪfˌlɔŋ]. Jaw drops less, the lips are more relaxed, and the tongue doesn’t shift back as much.
- it can be affected by `R`, The lips flare more, and the tongue pulls back more, and up a little bit: core[cɔɹ], sore[sɔɹ]

#### [a3.6 - Listen + Repeat: The AW as in LAW [ɔ] Vowel](engl.io/adp)
- ⤵️:aw [ɔ], saw [sɔ], along [əәˈlɔŋ], wrong [ɹɔŋ]
- ➖:aw [ɔ], recall [ˈɹi kɔl] (noun — the verb is [ɹɪˈkɔl]!), runoff [ˈɹʌn ɔf]

#### How to Pronounce Quarter
quarter in dictionary is [ˈkwɔɹ-dɜɹ], but americans pronunciate [ˈkɔɹ-dɜɹ]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: fall [fɔl]
- au: cause [kɔz]
- augh: daughter [ˈdɔd-əәɹ]
- aw: shawl [ʃɔl]
- ough: thought [θɔt]

### `æ`
jaw drops quite a bit. The tongue tip stays forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth. The back part of the tongue stretches up. Slightly lift the top lip

#### [v3.6 — The AA as in BAT [æ] Vowel](engl.io/adv)
This is a sound that changes depending on the following sound.
You can see the tongue, bacause is high in the back and low in the front, not as in `ɑ` sound. You can also see the corners of the mouth pull back and up a little bit.

- ⤵️➖: backtrack ['bækˌtɹæk]
- ⤵️: chapter['tʃæp-təɹ], can[kæn], act[ækt], last[læst], bank[bæŋk]
- ➖: baypass['baɪˌpæs]

- [æ] + [m] or [n] = the tongue relaxes in the back, making an UH sound after AA. AA-UH. It’s not a pure AA sound. The jar is no so open. The corners of the mouth do not come back and up as much. The tongue position is the same. Example: exam[ig'zæm], man[mæn], hand. [æ]+[n] = `æʌ` or `æə`
- [æ] + [ŋ] = ay[eɪ]. Example: gang[gæŋ]

#### [a3.8 - AH [ɑ] vs. AA [æ]](engl.io/ae4)
The back of the tongue presses down for [ɑ] and lifts for [æ]: ah [ɑ], aa [æ] - top [tɑp], tap [tæp] - mop [mɑp], map [mæp] - hot [hɑt], hat [hæt] - sock [sɑk], sack [sæk]

#### [a3.9 -AH [ɑ] vs. AA [æ] Test](engl.io/ae7)
Listen several times: 
1. [ɑ] or [æ]
2. bomb [ɑ] or bam [æ] 
3. bog [ɑ] or bag [æ]

- `n-m`: HAcer el a original y mover con el sonido a una a mas cerrada: e-a
- `ŋ`: eɪ
- the API is not a perfect tool, does not capture everything

#### [v3.9 —  English in Real Life: Easter](engl.io/aeb)

#### [a3.10 - Listen + Repeat: AA [æ] followed by Nasal Consonants](engl.io/aed)
ban [bæn] -> [bæʌn], exam [ɪgˈzæm] -> [ɪgˈzæʌm], thanks [θænks] -> [θeɪnks]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: bat [bæt]

- ai: plaid [plæd]
- i: timbre [ˈtæm-bəәɹ]

### `ɛ`
- `jaw` drops a good bit
- `tongue tip` is forward and down, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth
- `tongue middle/front` lifts towards the roof of the mouth. Make the middle of the tongue wider as it lifts.
- `resonates` in the middle of the mouth, but it’s still connected to the core placement in the upper chest and lower neck.

#### [v3.10 — The EH as in BED [ɛ] Vowel](engl.io/aee)
- ⤵️: said[sɛd], jaw drops more
- ➖: employ[ɛmˈplɔɪ], is shorter, there isn’t enough time to make the full jaw drop

minimal pairs: Bat/bet. Capped/kept. Jam/gem. Tack/tech. Rack/wreck.

#### [a3.12 - Listen + Repeat: AA [æ] vs. EH [ɛ]](engl.io/aek)
#### [a3.13 - Test Yourself: EH [ɛ] vs. AA [æ] Test](engl.io/aen)
1.[æ], 2.had [æ], 3.leapt [ɛ], 4.guess [ɛ], 5.cattle [æ]

You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English. - a: share [ʃɛəәɹ]
- ai: said [sɛd]
- ay: says [sɛz]
- ea: head [hɛd]
- e: shed [ʃɛd]
- eo: leopard [ˈlɛp-əәɹd]
- ie: friend [fɹɛnd]
- u: bury [ˈbɛɹ-i]

### `i`
- `jaw`: little bit of drop
- `tongue`: tip stays behind the bottom front teeth, and the middle/front part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth. It doesn’t touch the roof of the mouth, but it is very close.
- `lips`: The corners of the lips pull a little wide, sort of like a smile—they’re not quite relaxed.
- `tension`: little jaw and tongue tension as possible.
- `resonate`: Feel the vibration between your tongue and hard palate. But, as always, keep it connected to that lower placement at the base of the neck and upper chest.

#### [v3.12 — The EE as in SHE [i] Vowel](engl.io/aer)
- ⤵️: please[pliz], keep[kip], police[pәˈlis], meet[mit], each[itʃ]
- ➖: busy[ˈbɪz-i], early[ˈɜɹ-li], coffee[ˈkɔ-fi]. More relax, no time to make full mouth position

#### [a3.14 - Listen + Repeat: The EE as in SHE [i] Vowel](engl.io/aet)
You’ll see this sound spelled several ways in American English.
- ay: quay [ki]
- ea: heat [hit]
- e: be [bi]
- ee: weep [wip]
- ei: receive [ɹɪˈsiv]
- eo: people [ˈpi pəәl]
- ey: key [ki]
- ie: brief [bɹif]
- i: police [pəәˈlis]
- y: busy [ˈbɪz i]

### `ɪ` 
- `jaw`: drops a bit more than for the EE as in SHE [i], which means the arch of the tongue isn’t as close to the roof of the mouth. 
- `tongue`: tongue tip is forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth, and the front/mid part lifts up towards the roof of the mouth.
- `lips`: lips and the corners of the lips, stay relaxed.
- `placement`: For the EE as in SHE vowel, the vibration is along the front half of the hard palate. For the IH as in SIT [ɪ] vowel, it’s more in the middle of the mouth.

Tip: start with the EE as in SHE [i] vowel, then create a little more space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth by dropping your jaw just a bit more.

#### [v3.13 - The IH as in SIT Vowel](engl.io/aex)
- ⤵️: fix [fɪks]
- ➖: office [ˈɔ-fɪs]

#### [a3.15 - Listen + Repeat: The IH as in SIT [ɪ] Vowel](engl.io/aez)

#### [v3.14 - EE [i] vs. IH [ɪ]](engl.io/af2)
Remember for the EE [i](she) vowel, the tongue is very close to the roof of the mouth and the corners of the lips pull wide. For the IH [ɪ](sit) vowel, the lips are relaxed and the jaw drops a little more, allowing a little more space between the arch of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. 

Minimal pairs: it[ɪt], eat[it] - rich [ɹɪtʃ], reach [ɹitʃ] - living [ˈlɪv-ɪŋ], leaving [ˈliv-ɪŋ] - fist [fɪst], feast [fist] - ship [ʃɪp], sheep [ʃip] - tick[tɪk], teak[tik] - lip[lɪp], leap[lip] - snicker[ˈsnɪk-əɹ], sneaker[ˈsnik-əɹ]

#### [v3.15 - EE, IH, and Vowel Length](engl.io/af3)
don’t think about the length of the vowel being tied to the vowel itself. It’s tied to the syllable, and the sentence position, and maybe the ending consonant.
cap, cab - beat[bit], bid[bɪd] -  

#### [v3.16 - Beach vs. Bitch]
- good words: [i] beach, sheet. Tongue tip is down, and the front part of the tongue is lifting, very close to the roof of the mouth EE
- bad words: [ɪ] bitch, shit. More space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth. IH
