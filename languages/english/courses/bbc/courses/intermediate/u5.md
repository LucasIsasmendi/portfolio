## 1. Ordinal numbers

### a1
Try to say importants dates in english, so you will remember the vocabulary.

### a2
Pay attention to cardinals

### a3 - Marcus, the most disorganised man
Don't mix different forms in your essays or business communications. You should pick one form - and stick to it. Consistency is much more professional.

#### Vocabulary: Ordinals - meaning and use
Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group. They are used for:
1. Dates: It's the twelfth of November
2. The order of events:  Her fiftieth birthday
3. Position in space: Our apartment's on the first floor. It's the third on the right
4. Order of quality: The first prize in the competition

**Spelling and form**
- We usually form ordinal numbers by adding `-th` to cardinal numbers: four - `fourth`
- `first`, `second` and `third` are irregular forms
- `fifth`, `eighth`, `ninth`, `twelfth` and numbers ending in `-y` (drop the -y and replace it with `ieth`) have irregular spellings: `twentieth`
- We say dates with `the` and `of`: the eighth of April. April the eighth 
- But we don't write them like that. We write them as: 8th April | April 8th | 8 April
- First, second and third have the irregular suffixes `1st`, `2nd` and `3rd`
