# [Driving Digital Innovation through Experimentation](https://www.edx.org/course/driving-digital-innovation-through-bux-qd601x)

You will learn how to:
- Use a business experimentation cycle to deliver desired business outcomes
- Use operational processes, modular design and agile methods to develop iterative, Small-loop experiments that create continuous improvement
- Use operational processes, modular design and agile methods to drive Small-loop experiments
- Identify the need for, and manage the risks inherent in, Big-loop experiments, used to drive disruptive change
- Manage the knowledge interfaces among the variety of experts involved in g Big-loop experiments
- Manage your technical and organizational infrastructures to drive a capability for experimentation at scale
