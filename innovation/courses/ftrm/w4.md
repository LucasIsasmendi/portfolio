Once You understand the value of your opportunities, what market opportunities should you focus on?

A fundamental decision with fundamental implications: 
1. Market Choice is key for creating value and obtaining revenues
2. Market Choice is imprinting the DNA of your venture: culture, organization identity, who you are as organization, kind of people you are going to hire, type of customers
3. Yet...you may need to adapt your choice over time => Focus and Agility

A smart market opportunity strategy has to take into account:
- WHAT are the most attractive market opportunities that you should focus on?
- HOW can you focus and stay flexible, agiel and open-minded at the same time?

**The Agile Focus Strategy** is your way to combine this tow aspects to set an optimal strategy that reaps the greatest benefits from your commercialization efforts.

It balances the tension between focus and flexibility by consciously keeping other opportunities open: those that will allow you to (i) mitigate your risk and (ii) increase your value with minimum effort.
