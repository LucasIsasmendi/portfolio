## 5.2 - Implications of the Agile Focus Strategy
- The resources & capabilities that you will develop and build over time
- The identity, culture and structure of your venture
- The branding & marketing that you will employ in your commercialization efforts
- The fundraising efforts that you will engage in

### 5.2.1 Resources and capabilities
Understanding which market opportunities you want to keep open enables you to develop your resources and capabilities with greater flexibility and agility => Key when you need to pivot to another market, or when you want to diversify to new markets.

- `Build Modular Technology`: don't lock yourself into one particular development path with your technological capabilities to save time and money in short term. Make sure that your R&D team is aligned with this guidance.
- `Cast a Wider Intellectual Property Net`: protect your invention.
- `Build and Involve your Stakeholder network`: this could be your investors, your advisory board, or other potential partners and allies. All these stakeholders need to be aware of your Agile Focus Strategy, and even more importantly, may help you in its implementation. Hence, be smart about picking the right people.

### 5.2.2 Identity and culture
The markets a firm is serving are not only significant for its value creation potential, but also has a powerful influence on the DNA of your firm: what your firm is all about and how others will perceive it.

#### Imprinting the firm's identity
An `indentity` defines what is important and essential to the venture, and provides answers to questions such as:
- Who are we?
- What are we doing?
- What do we want to be in the future?

An identity cannot be changed easily. Hence, it is important to consider your range of market opportunities when developing your ideas of what your firm is and will be about.

> Example Augury: Machines Talk, We listen. We are bringing Predictive Maintenance to new markets.

#### Shaping the firm's culture
A firm's `culture` emphasizes the shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that shape how people behave in a firm. 
Your Agile Focus Strategy will influence the culture that you want to develop and see flourish in your venture.
In particular, you can implement a culture that values agility and innovativeness, as these are key for pursuing your Agile Focus Strategy and for remaining competitive.

> Auguryâ€™s founders, for example, initiate periodic breakout sessions in which their
employees gather together and brainstorm for new ideas. These gatherings nurture a culture of innovation and open-mindedness.

#### Shaping the structure of your firm
You can define the roles in the organization, or build your divisions in a way that will be aligned with your current and future market entry plans.
Structure your your firm to remains agile because plans change over time.

### 5.2.3 Branding and messaging
The information shown in the Dartboard is key for choosing your brand name and designing your marketing communication strategy in a way that reflects best what your company is and will be about.
A brand name that is focused on one particular application may lock you out when seeking to enter new markets.

Changing a brand name down the road means losing the reputation and the positioning that you worked so hard to achieve, and usually requires significant financial investment

#### Communicating with Potential Investors
The Agile Focus Strategy allows you to showcase the potential inherent in your venture in a simple and intuitive way: you can communicate your market entry strategy to investors, discuss risk mitigation strategies (i.e., backup options) and show how you align your funding needs with your market rollout plan (i.e, growth options).

Include the main outcomes of the Navigator process in your pitch deck and business plan.

Remember that investors are looking for a winning team and not just for a winning idea. Applying the Navigator also signals to investors that your team is rigorous and prudent, with broad insights and long term views.
