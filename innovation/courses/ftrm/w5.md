- Step 3: Agile Focus Dartboard (worksheet 3)

When ever you need to re-think your strategy, the Navigator can help you to find your path.

To make your learning process broad and complete, use the MON together with other key methods and business tools:
- Business Model & Value Proposition Canvases ( Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur)
- Lean Start-up (Eric Ries)

## 5.2 - Implications of the Agile Focus Strategy
- The resources & capabilities that you will develop and build over time
- The identity, culture and structure of your venture
- The branding & marketing that you will employ in your commercialization efforts
- The fundraising efforts that you will engage in

### 5.2.1 Resources and capabilities
Understanding which market opportunities you want to keep open enables you to develop your resources and capabilities with greater flexibility and agility => Key when you need to pivot to another market, or when you want to diversify to new markets.

- `Build Modular Technology`: don't lock yourself into one particular development path with your technological capabilities to save time and money in short term. Make sure that your R&D team is aligned with this guidance.
- `Cast a Wider Intellectual Property Net`: protect your invention.
- `Build and Involve your Stakeholder network`: this could be your investors, your advisory board, or other potential partners and allies. All these stakeholders need to be aware of your Agile Focus Strategy, and even more importantly, may help you in its implementation. Hence, be smart about picking the right people.

### 5.2.2 Identity and culture
The markets a firm is serving are not only significant for its value creation potential, but also has a powerful influence on the DNA of your firm: what your firm is all about and how others will perceive it.

#### Imprinting the firm's identity
An `indentity` defines what is important and essential to the venture, and provides answers to questions such as:
- Who are we?
- What are we doing?
- What do we want to be in the future?

An identity cannot be changed easily. Hence, it is important to consider your range of market opportunities when developing your ideas of what your firm is and will be about.

> Example Augury: Machines Talk, We listen. We are bringing Predictive Maintenance to new markets.

#### Shaping the firm's culture
A firm's `culture` emphasizes the shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that shape how people behave in a firm. 
Your Agile Focus Strategy will influence the culture that you want to develop and see flourish in your venture.
In particular, you can implement a culture that values agility and innovativeness, as these are key for pursuing your Agile Focus Strategy and for remaining competitive.

> Augury’s founders, for example, initiate periodic breakout sessions in which their
employees gather together and brainstorm for new ideas. These gatherings nurture a culture of innovation and open-mindedness.

#### Shaping the structure of your firm
You can define the roles in the organization, or build your divisions in a way that will be aligned with your current and future market entry plans.
Structure your your firm to remains agile because plans change over time.

### 5.2.3 Branding and messaging
The information shown in the Dartboard is key for choosing your brand name and designing your marketing communication strategy in a way that reflects best what your company is and will be about.
A brand name that is focused on one particular application may lock you out when seeking to enter new markets.

Changing a brand name down the road means losing the reputation and the positioning that you worked so hard to achieve, and usually requires significant financial investment

#### Communicating with Potential Investors
The Agile Focus Strategy allows you to showcase the potential inherent in your venture in a simple and intuitive way: you can communicate your market entry strategy to investors, discuss risk mitigation strategies (i.e., backup options) and show how you align your funding needs with your market rollout plan (i.e, growth options).

Include the main outcomes of the Navigator process in your pitch deck and business plan.

Remember that investors are looking for a winning team and not just for a winning idea. Applying the Navigator also signals to investors that your team is rigorous and prudent, with broad insights and long term views.

#### Summary
So before you...
- Develop your technology
- File your patents
- Recruit new Employees
- Engage your stakeholders
- Nurture your company culture
- Pick a brand name
- Design your marketing materials

... make sure to set your Agile Focus Strategy

## 5.3 - The on-going use of the Navigator
If you're not pursuing a valuable market opportunity, you're probably wasting your time, your energy, and your resources.
*Are we running in the right direction—is* therefore one of the most pressing questions for entrepreneurs and innovators.

**Benefits from the Navigator over time**
- Trace back, track & update your decision
- Navigate the pivoting process
- Navigate the growth process

### 5.3.1 Trace, track and update
#### Are You running in the right direction?
Doubts that poke your confidence arise for many reasons:
- External changes in your business emvironment
- Internal modifications in your firm's abilities
- New opportunities that knock on your door

Whatever the reason may be, you can always go back to the structured evaluation of the Market Opportunity Navigation:
- Check your new assumptions
- Support or refute your doubts
- Align your strategy if necessary

> Avoid opportunism, make an evaluation.

#### Trace back, track & update your decision
Progress from: `Intuition -> Informed intuition -> Fact-based decision`

Use the Navigator with the information that you currently possess to decide on your next action items... until you are sufficiently knowledgeable to set your strategy.

Learn more about your current market opportunities and update their positioning in the Attractiveness Map and in the Agile Focus Strategy.
Sistematically work with newly arising market opportunities, position them in the Attractiveness Map and consider them for an updated Agile Focus Strategy.

As you track and update the Navigator, you actually make your learning process and the evolution of your venture more visible.
Date your updates and save them so that you can always go back for a review. This will help you to understand what has changed, and how the logic of your strategy has developed over time.

### 5.3.2 Navigate the pivoting and growth process
#### Pivote
AFS helps you to cope with pivoting more easily, as you will:
- Develop wider capabilities
- Have backup options in store
- Learn about other opportunities along the way

> Update the Navigator to make your pivoting choice more apparent

#### Growth
Once your efforts prove successful, you can use the MON to decide on your next target opportunities. 

Attractiveness and relatedness will be your main considerations.

You may also use the options that you have placed in storage as licensing opportunities, to create an additional income stream.

#### Develop the right DNA
Applying the Navigator framework over time will not only help you in setting a promising strategy, but will also help you in developing a proper DNA for your emerging venture - one that facilitates a structured and through process when important decisions are on the table

#### Summary
MON can be of great value throughout your entrepreneurial journey, so make it a habit to use it, update the Navigator time to time, and set dedicated team meetings to discuss your situation.

## 5.4 - Using the Navigator with other business tools

Designing a business strategy is complicated, it envolves an iterative process of learning, planning, validating.
This is way MON allows seamless integration with other major buiness tools and mutually reinforces those tools, making their use more valuable.

Specifically, the MON is designed to work seamlessly with:
- The Business Model Canvas and the Value Proposition Canvas: outstanding frameworks for planning your strategy
- The Lean Start-up Methodology: a key method for vlidating your strategy

> Together, they from a powerful **Suite of Tools** that clearly lays out the planning and validation processes, as you strive to find your promising path

### 5.4.1 Combining the Navigator with the Business Model and Value Proposition Canvases
While the Navigator provides an excellent framework for assessing your complete landscape of opportunities, the Business Model and the Value Proposition Canvases provide great frameworks for zooming in to the details of a specific market opportunity.
Combine these tools together to enhance your frameworks for strategic planning.

- The `Business Model Canvas`, is one of the most commonly used tools for designing a business model. It captures your offering, your customers, your required infrastructure, and your finances in a single easy-to-use template that seek to explain how your business can create value with its offering.
- The `Value Proposition Canvas`, zooms in on two key sales of the Business Model Canvas: value proposition, and a customer segment. This canvas helps innovators to find the fit between their offering and their customers, how to build an attractive offering that will create value to customers.

#### Combining macro and micro views
The navigator provides a powerful `macro view` on the landscape of opportunities.
Each market opportunity should have a clear `micro planning` that details its:
- :heavy_check_mark: Busines model - how to create value to the firm
- :heavy_check_mark: Value proposition - how to create value to the customers  

The macro view is essential for uncovering and comparing your options, so that you can choose which markets to play in.

The micro view is essential for understanding how to actually play in the market.

Each level of analysis provides important inputs to the others, so you can drill down and go up in an iterative manner.

For instance, you will need to understand your Value Proposition Canvas to be able to
evaluate a market opportunity and map it on the attractiveness map, and you will need
to understand your Agile Focus Strategy to be able to design a winning business model.

#### Based on your Agile Focus Strategy
- Design your business model to address an attractive market opportunity -> which customer segments are the best to address with our resources.
- Desing your Business Model to be flexible -> partners, your channels, your key activities and resources, or even the type of relationships that you build with your customers; they can all be designed with your smart portfolio in mind to enable your smoother pivoting or an easier growth in the future.

### 5.4.2 Combining the Navigator with the Lean Startup Method
The Lean Start-up Methodology: Discover and validate your target customers through rapid market testing and continuous pivoting. Therefore they should adapt rapid `Build-Measure-Learn` feedback loops that involve the formulation of assumptions, their validation or their adaptation if required.

<img src="files/w5/lean-startup.jpg" width="20%">

The first step of this loop is therefore figuring out the problem that needs to be solved, and then developing a Minimum Viable Product to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible.

#### Broad & complete learning process
1. `Combine planning and experimentation`: The Navigator offers a process to rigorously plan and define your market domains and the Lean Method offers a process to understand and to validate the customers' needs. It is an iterative process: meaningful experimentations. After that, you can build a Minimum Viable Product and get out of the building to learn about real customer needs.
You can then go back to the Navigator to reflect and to update your market opportunity set, your attractiveness map, and your Agile Focus Strategy according to what you have just learned. Combining planning and experimenting in such an iterative process enables you to be both predictive and adaptive, and this is quite powerful.

2. `Combine broad and targeted prespectives`: The Lean Method pushes you to examine a single, targeted path while the Navigator guides you to see the broad landscape of opportunities. This overview can save you from going down the wrong path in your experimentations. It help you to find the global maximum rather than a local one.

3. `Combine customers and market hypotheses`: The Lean Method pushes you to validate your hypoteses about customers. These hypotheses are usually based on the nine building blocks of the Business Model
Canvas, and emphasized mainly the Value Proposition aspect.
The Navigator's evaluation process offers an additional set of hypotheses to examine other aspects of the market and it's environmental context: attractiveness of an opportunity based on its potential and its challenge; your competitors, or your value chain actors. This way you can generate market hypothesis on top of your customer hypothesis, and actually base your strategic choice on a more inclusive set of considerations.

4. `Combine short and long learning loops`: The Lean Method emphasizes the importance of short feedback loops. The Navigator is indispensible in cases that cannot be tested in a quick series of experiments, as it allows you to discover the most promising path and to remain agile if adaptation is required.
