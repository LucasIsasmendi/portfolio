As entrepreneur or innovator you are trained to run fast, but, Are you running in the right direction?

Choosing the right market for your innovation is the biggest, and trickiest, question for innovators. Research has shown that all too often entrepreneurs don’t spend enough time identifying and researching their market opportunities – instead they jump at the first opportunity that looks good, and fail to properly evaluate and leverage other opportunities. This common mistake means that you often choose the wrong market or lock yourself into one specific direction.

In this course, you will learn how to set a promising strategy, by using a business tool called the Market Opportunity Navigator.

This tool offers an easy to apply framework to better identify, evaluate and focus on the right market opportunities.

It works in three simple steps, with dedicated worksheets to guide you through the process:

1. Search broadly - to generate your set of market opportunities
2. Assess deeply - to evaluate your options and compare their attractiveness
3. Strategize smartly - to focus on the most attractive opportunity while remaining agile

At the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Generate a set of market opportunities stemming from your core strengths
- Evaluate the attractiveness of market opportunities in a comprehensive manner
- Make an informed strategic choice, that will increase your chances of focusing on a promising market
- Balance focus and flexibility- two critical aspects for gaining success
- Develop a mindset that nourishes open mindedness and receptiveness to adaptation
