### Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting
[link](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-9813f617b3)  
The biggest tragedy for any founder isn't failure. It's becoming trapped inside a business that you don't actually like.

#### What do you want for your life?
No matter what you want in life, starting a business is a powerful way to help you get it. But you have to know what you want first.

#### Getting to Know Yourself
This should be your first step as a founder. Before you come up with an idea, before you find a partner, before you do anything, take the time to examine who you are.


### Goal Setting: A Scientific Guide to Setting and Achieving Goals

#### What is Goal Setting?
Rather than considering what kind of success we want, we should ask, “What kind of pain do I want?”. The real challenge is not determining if you want the result, but if you are willing to accept the sacrifices required to achieve your goal.
Everybody wants a gold medal. Few people want to train like an Olympian.

If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a million dollar business. Your system is your sales and marketing process.

Goals are useful for setting the direction. Systems are great for actually making progress.

#### How to Set Goals You’ll Actually Follow
1. **Ruthlessly Eliminate Your Goals**: your goals are competing with one another for your time and attention. Focus on one goal at a time. What we really need is not bigger goals, but better focus. Check strategies in the link
2. **Stack Your Goals**: After/Before [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. You are 2x to 3x more likely to stick to your goals if you make a specific plan for when, where, and how you will perform the behavior.
3. **Set an Upper Bound**: zone of long-term growth between laziness and burnout. You want to push hard enough to make progress, but not so much that it is unsustainable.  “I want to make at least 10 sales calls today, but not more than 20.”

#### How to Achieve Your Goals Consistently
You need to align your environment with your ambitions if you wish to make progress for the long-run. It's very hard to stick with positive habits in a negative environment.
Some strategies to design better default decisions
- Simplicity: When in doubt, eliminate options.
- Visual Cues: visually nudges your actions in the right direction.
- Opt-Out vs. Opt-In: Opt-In by default

#### How to Measure Your Goals
One of the most motivating things we can experience is evidence of our progress. This is why measurement is so critical for effective goal setting. The things we measure are the things we improve.

The trick is to realize that counting, measuring, and tracking is not about the result. Measure to discover, to find out, to understand. Measure to see if you are showing up. Measure to see if you're actually spending time on the things that are important to you.
