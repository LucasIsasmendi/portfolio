## Building a Side Project Without Quitting Your Day Job

Side Projects: 
- Grow, Improve, and Surprise
- Increase Creativity

### Find the Time: Seizing “Leftover Minutes”
### Find the Need: Delivering Extreme Value
### Find the Fun: Imbuing Your Project with Passion
> The only way a side project will work is if people give themselves permission to think simple, to change their minds, to fail — basically, to not take them too seriously.
> When you treat something like it’s stupid, you have fun with it, you don’t put too much structure around it. You can enjoy different types of success.

So make it something that you’re into, that your really feelin’. Because, for the time being, the enjoyment and satisfaction that you get out of your project will be your only reward.

> A side project is a Labor of Love. You provide the ‘Labor’. And you provide the ‘Love’.
> So when you spend time on it, it is because you really want to. That keeps you coming back and pushing it on.

### Find the Peace: Relaxing With Imperfection
The rest of your life will likely be about meeting goals, hitting targets, and living up to expectations.

This part of your life isn’t. It’s your time to play, tinker, try things out, and wander down paths that don’t have a clear destination.

Wanting to get somewhere in as little time as possible is the surest way to kill off inspiration of any kind.

The best way to approach a side project is as an experiment, rather than something with a clear-cut goal.

> Experiments don’t ‘fail’ — they simply prove or disprove a hypothesis. So focus on the task at hand. Not the end result.

So go in without expectations and see what happens.
Something always does.

### The Big Takeaway
Don’t be scared to invest time and effort into something that truly makes you tick. It won’t distract you or tire you out; it will energize you.

Worst case scenario, you sate your curiosity.
Best case scenario, you discover your life’s work.
But either way, don’t worry too much.
After all, it’s only a side project.
