Just as important as finding your customer is creating a great product that will solve the customer’s problem.  How will customers acquire your product?  How will it solve the customer’s problem? What value will your product bring?  What is your secret sauce?  How do you stack up vis-à-vis the competition?

Many seemingly great ideas and technologies come to a sudden halt in the face of one simple, inescapable question:
"Who is your customer?"
MIT has been asking its student entrepreneurs this question for many years – and with great success. The 25,600 companies started by MIT alumni generate $2 trillion in revenue and have created 3.3 million jobs. If MIT were a country, it would be the 11th largest economy in the world.
