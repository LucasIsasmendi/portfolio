## Week 1 - Introduction to Crypto and Cryptocurrencies

### Cryptographic Hash Functions
Hash function:
    * takes any string as input
    * fixed-size outpu (we'll use 256 bits)
    * efficiently computable

Security properties:
    * collision-free
        - Nobodycan can find x and y such that x!=y and H(x)=H(y) [collision, H:Hash]
        - collisions do exist, but can anyone find them?
        - How to find a collision: 2^130 tries with 99.8% success (too long to matter)
    * hiding
    * puzzle-friendly
