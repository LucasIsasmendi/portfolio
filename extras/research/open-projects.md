## CryptoCoinJS
[web](http://cryptocoinjs.com/) | [github](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/)

CryptoCoinJS is a JavaScript project that helps you to interface with many of the crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more. Most of the modules are fully compatible with the browser and Node.js. Naturally, the modules that interface directly with peer nodes won't run in the browser.
