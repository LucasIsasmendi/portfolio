2. The decision imprints your venture or your innovation process, will shape other decisions that you will take over time and that then put your in a certain trend channel or path. and this will actually be very difficult to undo if you need to change direction.

Forbes: "Understanding where to focus is a real dilemma for entrepreneurs". Firms rarely fails because their teams don't work hard enough,  but they fail because their teams actually works on the wrong things.

### Why is a difficult decision?
- There is always uncertainty: is inherent to the innovation process (known unknowns and unknown unknowns )
- There are always trade-offs: big markets growing slow, small markets protected, etc
- Markets are constantly changing

Making the right market opportunity choiceis definitely the key for creatingsignificant value and success.

### What can go wrong?
1. Focusing on the wrong market opportunity. Before you start running fast, make sure you are running in the right direction
2. Improper balance between focus and flexibility
    - Startups must focus sharply if they want to win the race
    - Startups must stay flexible if they want want to win the race

> Don't get trapped!: If you are lightning focused on just one thing and aren't willing to consider others, you probably don't have the flexibility to make it when your things don't go according to plan" - Stephen Kaufer, cofounder tripAdvisor
