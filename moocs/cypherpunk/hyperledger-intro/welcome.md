# Welcome & Introduction


## A Word from Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director at Hyperledger
Hyperledger is really the first series of projects focused on enterprise blockchain applications.
And that means using distributed ledger technologies in a permission setting, it means using smart contracts to automate various business processes, and it means building a really exciting new world, secure, trustworthy information systems and automation of business processes.

### Inspiration Behind the Course (Brian Behlendorf)
So, it's really intended to give that kind of overview, as well as to talk a little bit about what is it, what do we mean when we say blockchains for business, how is that different from the cryptocurrency landscape, what are the mechanics of these, what are consensus mechanisms, what is a smart contract.

### [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/)
Hyperledger is the umbrella open source project that The Linux Foundation has created and hosted since 2015. It aims at advancing and promoting cross-industry blockchain technologies to ensure accountability, transparency, and trust among business partners. As a result, Hyperledger makes business network and transactions more efficient.

These benefits are valued by leaders across many industries, including technology, finance healthcare, supply chain, and automotive, among several others.

Hyperledger offers different blockchain platforms. This course will present three of them: Iroha, Sawtooth, and Fabric.
