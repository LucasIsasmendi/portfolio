# Week 1 - Welcome module

## Welcome
There are two main goals for this course. The first is to introduce you to basic business English skills that we feel you will need in the workplace. The second goal is to enhance your English proficiency skills.

## Introduction
It includes four courses and one capstone project. The four courses are separated into different subject areas starting with Basic Business Literacy Skills followed by Business Writing, Business Speaking, and finally Cross Cultural Communication.  
Each course will be structured in a similar way with each containing six modules to work through.  
Every module and every course will provide you with the necessary skills to proceed throughout this specialization.  
Every module is separated into two specific sections. Content and language. In the content sections you should expect to learn about basic business communication skills whether it's for writing or speaking in real world business situations. The language sections will help you learn basic vocabulary, and improve your grammar, pronunciation, and other language skills.  

## Learning vocabulary

### Online resources for learning vocabulary

- [Macmillian Dictionary](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/)
- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/)
- [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- [The Free Dictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/)
- [Word Reference](http://www.wordreference.com/)

### Going beyond definitions
Simply memorising definitions or translations is not enough.
You can learn new vocabulary by organising words into hierarchies: Company - Manager - Employee.  
Or you could review common word collocations (words that often appear together):
manage poeple, manage companies, manage risk.

### [Word Neighbors](http://wordneighbors.ust.hk)
The tool allows you to look up common word combinations (collocations) and review how they are used in real situations. You will often be advised to use this tool throughout the Specialization. [tutorial](http://wordneighbors.ust.hk/help/index.html).
