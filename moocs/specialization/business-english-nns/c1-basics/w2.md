# Week 2 - Communication basics

## What is communication?
We'll take a look at written discourse, written versus spoken discourse, we'll take a look at how verbal and non-verbal communication worked together, and how you can enhance meeting with both of them.
Then we'll look at how image and body language play important role in communication, all within a business context.

## Communication Channels
Basically, the channel of communication refers to the means through which the message is passed, and there are different channels of communication that we can think of.

## Verbal & non-verbal communication
the non verbal communication is an important component to the verbal communication, because it enhances the meaning of what you're trying to say.

Other things that are included in non verbal communication are things that are not always related to your body language. It might also be the space between you and the speakers. If you look at, for example, Edward T Hall's diagram of personal reaction bubbles, you can see that perhaps if I'm very intimate with someone, and I wanna communicate a message with them, I might move closer to them, all right. This is an important example for presentations, or even in a job interview. The space that you have with a speaker can also enhance your meaning. So for example, if I get closer to the speaker, I might be telling the person that what I'm saying is really important, you should listen.
