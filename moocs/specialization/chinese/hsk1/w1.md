- [Pronunciation of initials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hsk-1/supplement/FKZzg/pronunciation-of-initials): The content here is mainly from Wikipedia with audio in the 4 tones.
- [Nǐ] and [hǎo] are both third tones. When two-third tones are read in sequence, the first syllable turns into the second tone. So, `nǐ hǎo` it's read `ní hǎo` rather than nǐ hǎo. 
- To ask somebody's name in Chinese is `Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?`. To respond, you say `wǒ jiào` followed by your name
