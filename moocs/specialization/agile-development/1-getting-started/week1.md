In course 1, we'll show you how to humanize your customer or your user with personas and learn what's on their a list by using problem scenarios.

In course 2, running design sprints will show you how to use one week design sprints to, go research those personas and problem scenarios. Number two, to go out and test motivation. And in the third type of design sprints, we'll show you how to test usability. And in the fourth, we'll show you how to look at architectural alternatives and consider those, you make good decisions about how to build your product. All the ProcessDiagramForward

In course 3, we'll show you how to use a lot of these things you probably heard about in relation to agile, stand ups and methodologies like XP and scrum. And we'll show you how to evaluate those against the fundamental jobs of software development, rather than just rattling through them. So that you can decide which are most applicable or most likely to be applicable to your project, your team, your particular situation. 

In course 4, we'll show you how to create a culture of experimentation. Nothing will more reliably improve your practice of agile than testing everything, whether that's an idea about how to be delivering something valuable to your user or making your practice of agile better. Testing that will help you manage the uncertainty inherent in any software execution, so that uncertainty doesn't manage you.

## What's hard about creating excellent products

### What Is Agile?
**Agile Manifesto**
- Individuals Interactions > Process tools
- Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation
- Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
- Responding to Change > Following a Plan

**Focal Points**
- Focus on the individual with testable narratives
- Frontload value
- Outcomes vs. Output

> Only 20% of software features developed are used regularly. We're using Agile techniques in order to increase this percentage and create better (more usable) software.
