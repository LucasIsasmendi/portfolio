## Lesson 1: Processes and Practices

Processes are organized into phases or stages that runs in sequence, iteratively or in parallel. Examples:
- Specification: the idea for the product is conceived, requirements are elicited and expressed.
- Design and implementation: development
- Verification and validation: the product is assessed to make sure that it works the way it should and that it meets the client's needs.

Phases are composed of activities, and activities are groups of related tasks.
