## Pronunciation

### Key Pronunciation: Stress & Intonation

Stress **1 syllable** in every word:
- Loudly
- Higher
- Longer

Sentence stress gives english its rhythm and beat.
When we say a sentence, some words are strong, and others are weak.
The last word is strongest and longest. Rhythm = weak + strong .
"He **bought** some **jeans**"  
"He **bought** a **pair** of **jeans**"  
"**Jhon** **bought** **two** **pairs** of **jeans**"

**Content Words (Meaning)**  
The important words (verb, nouns) are stressed (longer, lauder, have a beat). If you take them out, the sentence will make no sense.
- Action verbs(teach, talk, sing)
- Nouns (name, computer, Atlanta)
- Adjectives (green, big, interesting)
- Adverbs (quickly, loudly, never)
- WH questions words (who, what, where, how)
- Negatives (no, not, don't, can't)

**Structure Words**  
Are the words that we don't stress (shorter and softer). We use them to construct our sentences. If you remove them, the sentence will still make sense.
- prepositions (in, on ,at)
- pronouns (it, she, he, you)
- articles (a, an, the)
- modals (can, should, would)
- helping verbs (be, do, have)

**Intonation**: It's the way your voice riseswhen you ask a question that gets yes or not for an answer.
- "Do you have the **letter**?" -"**Yes**, I do"
- "Did you make the **call**?" -"**No**, I didn't"

Intonation is also the way your voice rises and fall when you make a statement or ask an information question.
"Winter weather in Berlin is cold and **huMId**".  
"What's the weather like in **yoUR COuntry**"  
Rising falling intotation tells your listener that you're finished.

> The best way to improve these skills is to listen and practice.

A very important part of learning English is understanding stress and using it correctly. If you want to learn how to speak English well, you need to learn the basic rules of stress and then apply them in your speech.

What is stress? Stress falls on only one syllable of a word with two or more syllables. When we emphasize a syllable, it is usually louder, the vowel sound is longer, and the pitch (tone) is higher.

EXERCISE: Pronounce each word and mark the vowel of the syllable that receives stress. Use an [audio dictionary](http://www.learnersdictionary.com/) to listen to pronunciation. Compare your answer to the stress marked in the dictionary
