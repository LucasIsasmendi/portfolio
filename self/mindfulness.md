| Richard J. Davidson | TEDxSanFrancisco | [yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CBfCW67xT8)  

The four pillars of a healthy mind:
1. **Awareness**: the capacity to focus our attention, to resist distraction. It also includes `meta-awareness`, knowing what our minds are doing, it's necessary to real transformation to occur.
2. **Connection**: qualities that nurture harmonius interpersonal relationships, like appreciation, kindness, compassion, potive outlook
3. **Insight**: the narrative that we have about ourselves. Change your relation to the narrative, see at what it is, is a costellation of thoughts
4. **Purpose**: having a sense that our life is headed in a particular direction. Take more activities related to this sense of purpose. Live your life in a way that doing the laundry and taking out the garbage is related to your sense of purpose.


In order to cultivate this qualities, we need `declarative learning`-learn about things- and `procedural learning`-

The brain can change really fast, and with systematic practice these changes will endure.

Wish to a person: "May you be happy, may you be free of suffering"
