## Introduction

Jung retreated to Bollingen, not to escape his professional life, but instead to advance it.

**Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate

If you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme.

Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.

The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. Email, twitter, facebook, etc.

A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends more than 60 percent of the workweek engaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to 30 percent of a worker’s time dedicated to reading and answering e-mail alone.

**Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
