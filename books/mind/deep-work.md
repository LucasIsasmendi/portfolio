## Introduction

Jung retreated to Bollingen, not to escape his professional life, but instead to advance it.

**Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate

If you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme.

Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.

The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. Email, twitter, facebook, etc.

A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends more than 60 percent of the workweek engaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to 30 percent of a worker’s time dedicated to reading and answering e-mail alone.

**Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

**Part 2: The Rules**

## R1 Work Deeply
Eudaimonia: Greek concept, a state in which you’re achieving your full human potential.
One of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial. Most people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength. People fight desires all day long.
The lure of the Internet and television proved especially strong: The subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly addictive distractions only around half the time.

**You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.**

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy
You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life.

#### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. In my experience, the monastic philosophy makes many knowledge workers defensive. On the other hand, if you’re inside this pool—someone whose contribution to the world is discrete, clear, and individualized—then you should give this philosophy serious consideration, as it might be the deciding factor between an average career and one that will be remembered.

#### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
(Jung’s approach) This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches.
The minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day.
Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking.

#### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep.
The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar.

#### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
You fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule (Walter Isaacson). Journalists are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession. This approach is not for the deep work novice.

### Ritualize
Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants.
Rituals minimized the friction on the transition to depth, allowing to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer.
- Where you’ll work and for how long: Identify a location used only for depth; like a quit library. Give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge.
- How you’ll work once you start to work: Rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. No internet, pages per 20 minutes.
- How you’ll support your work: start with a cup of good coffee, mate, food. Or integrate light exercise like walking. Minimize energy-dissipating friction. Don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment.

To work deeply is a big deal and should not be an activity undertaken lightly.

### Make Grand Gestures
By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. It’s not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand.

**Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.**

### Don’t Work Alone
The relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It’s worth taking the time to untangle, however, because properly leveraging collaboration can increase the quality of deep work in your professional life.
The theory of serendipitous creativity, seems well justified by the historical record.
The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.
For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.

1. Distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.
2. Even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.

Consider the use of collaboration when appropriate

### Execute Like a Business
The division between what and how is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world.
The 4DX framework (the how):
- **1: Focus on the Wildly Important**: The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish. Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.
- **2: Act on the Lead Measures**: lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals. Time spent in a dws (deep-work-state)
- **3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard**
- **4: Create a Cadence of Accountability**: weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead. Celebrate good weeks, understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead.

The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing.

### Be Lazy
Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets… it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.

Inject regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day.
At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely.

**understand the science behind the value of downtime**
- Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights: some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle: unconscious thought theory (UTT). For application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.
Diversifi the type of work you deploy.
- Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply: Attention restoration theory (ART): spending time in nature(inherently fascinating stimuli, 50 minutes) can improve your ability to concentrate. To concentrate requires direct attention (walking in a bussy city), this resource is finite. Trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.
- Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important. Your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks.

The three reasons just described support the general strategy of maintaining a strict endpoint to your workday: once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.
**Create a shutdown ritual**, write down the pending tasks and the way to complete them; this facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits. When it is completed say “Shutdown complete”: it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.

Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work.

## R2 Embrace Boredom
The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.
Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. If every moment of potential boredom in your life is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where it’s not ready for deep work.

### Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.
Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.
A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of similar mental training.

- 1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.
- 2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
- 3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training. Set offlines blocks, wait and be bored.

> to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.

### Work Like Teddy Roosevelt
The amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small, but his concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off [from schoolwork] than most.
Process: identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.
Try this experiment no more than once a week at first—giving your brain practice with intensity, but also giving it (and your stress levels) time to rest in between.
Once you feel confident in your ability to trade concentration for completion time, increase the frequency of these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, however, to always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility. You should be able to consistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration.

### Meditate Productively
The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls; it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles and sharpens your concentration. Have at least two or three such sessions in a typical week.
Suggestions:
1. Be Wary of Distractions and Looping: When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back. We aware of loopings (minds try to save energy)
2. Structure Your Deep Thinking: cycle of reviewing and storing variables, identifying and tackling the next-step question, then consolidating your gains.

### Memorize a Deck of Cards
A side effect of memory training is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate.
Professional memory athletes never attempt rote memorization, that is, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head. This approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brains work. We’re not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We are, however, really good at remembering scenes.

[how to memorize a deck of cards](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-memorize-a-deck-of-cards/)
To prepare for this high-volume memorization task begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in your home, fix in your mind a collection of ten (large) items in each of these rooms. Then establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. Associate a memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. Then place a person in each room with each item in order.
Proceeding through the steps described earlier requires that you focus your attention, again and again, on a clear target. Like a muscle responding to weights, this will strengthen your general ability to concentrate—allowing you to go deeper with more ease.

## R4 Drain The Shallows
In the summer of 2007, the software company 37signals (now called Basecamp) launched an experiment: They shortened their workweek from five days to four: When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely. The company gave its employees the entire month of June off to work deeply on their own projects. If you not only eliminate shallow work, but also replace this recovered time with more of the deep alternative, not only will the business continue to function; it can become more successful.

Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. Limited to four hours. Shallow work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact.

### Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
When you’re done scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a block. You have, in effect, given every minute of your workday a job. Now as you go through your day, use this schedule to guide you. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward: “What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?”

Without structure, it’s easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow. Deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect. Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday.

### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity
An advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re actually spending in shallow activities.

### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget
settle on a specific answer, try to stick to this budget. This limit frees up space for significant amounts of deep effort on a consistent basis. Without these numbers, it’s difficult for an entrepreneur to say no to any opportunity that might generate some positive return.

### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty (fixed-schedule + time-management)
fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.
Nagpal set a limit of fifty hours a week and worked backward to determine what rules and habits were needed to satisfy this constraint. She, in other words, deployed fixed-schedule productivity.

In addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly conscientious about managing my time. Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to allow a large deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial, because I didn’t take a moment to craft a smart plan.

Fixed-schedule productivity is a meta-habit that’s simple to adopt but broad in its impact.

### Become Hard to Reach
“we are slowly eroding our ability to explain—in a careful, complex way—why it is so wrong for us to complain, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they are manageable.”

#### Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work
- email filters: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.”
- FAQ section
- pay a fee

#### Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails
What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion? It is
the process-centric approach to e-mail, and it’s designed to minimize both the number of e-mails you receive and the amount of mental clutter they generate. They require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them.

#### Tip #3: Don’t Respond
“Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.”

## Conclusion
In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the cover of Popular Electronics. Gates realizes that there’s an opportunity to design software for the machine, so he drops everything and with the help of Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff spends the next eight weeks hacking together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story is often cited as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but recent interviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s happy ending: Gates’s preternatural deep work ability.

Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during this two-month stretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his keyboard in the middle of writing a line of code. He would then sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and pick up right where he left off: “Gates was a serial obsessor.”

Deep work is important not because distraction is evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester.
