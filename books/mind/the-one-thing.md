## 4. Everything Matters Equally


## 10. The Focusing Question

> And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun on one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it. “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” is all wrong.- Carnegie.

The Focusing Question helps keep your first step from being a misstep. The quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question. Questions engage our critical thinking. To get the answers we seek, we have to invent the right questions.

The Focusing Question: **What is the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?**

The Focusing Question can lead you to answer not only “big picture” questions (Where am I going? What target should I aim for?) but also “small focus” ones as well (What must I do right now to be on the path to getting the big picture? Where’s the bull’s-eye?).
It tells you not only what your basket should be, but also the first step toward getting it.
It’s both a map for the big picture and a compass for your smallest next move.
Each time you ask it, you see your next priority

- Great questions are the path to great answers.
- big picture and small focus. One is about finding the right direction in life and the other is about finding the right action.

## 11. The Success Habit
When we start and continue a way of thinking or a way of acting over a long enough period, we’ve created a new habit. The choice we face is whether or not we want to form habits that get us what we want from life. If we do, then the Focusing Question is the most powerful success habit we can have.

Do it again and again until all dominoes are lined up: Over time, you’ll develop your own sense of when to use the big-picture question and when to use the small-focus question.

The Focusing Question can direct you to your ONE Thing in the different areas of your life. Simply reframe the Focusing Question by inserting your area of focus. You can also include a time frame—such as “right now” or “this year”—to give your answer the appropriate level of immediacy, or “in five years” or “someday” to find a big-picture answer that points you at outcomes to aim for.

**Big Ideas**: Understand and believe it. Use it. Make it a habit. Leverage reminders. Recruit support.

## 12. The Path to Great Answers
You ask a great question, then you seek out a great answer. Great questions, like great goals, are big and specific. They push you, stretch you, and aim you at big, specific answers. And because they’re framed to be measurable, there’s no wiggle room about what the results will look like.

### 1. Ask a Great Question: Four Quadrants
- Quadrant 4. Small & Specific: What can I do to increase sales by 5 percent this year?”
- Quadrant 3. Small & Broad: “What can I do to increase sales?”
- Quadrant 2. Big & Broad: “What can I do to double sales?”
- Quadrant 1. Big & Specific: “What can I do to double sales in six months?”
=> FQ: ”What’s the ONE Thing I can do to double sales in six months such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”

### 2. Find a Great Answer
Answers come in three categories: 
- `doable`: you already know it
- `stretch`: research and study
- and `possibility`: beyond what is already known and being done. Research, model, benchmark (max from strech), and trend (what comes next) experience from people that already done that path. You’re not the first person to dream big, so you’d be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons.

The benchmark is today’s success—the trend is tomorrow’s.
Benchmarking and trending is your best option. Because your answer will be original, you’ll probably have to reinvent yourself in some way to implement it. A new answer usually requires new behavior,

**Big Ideas**: Think big and specific. Think posibilities. [***]Benchmark and trend for the best answer.


**Part 3 - Extraordinary Results: Unlocking the Possibilities Within You**
There is a natural rhythm to our lives that becomes a simple formula for implementing the ONE Thing and achieving extraordinary results: purpose, priority, and productivity.
In business, profit and productivity are also driven by priority and purpose.

## 13. Live with Purpose
Our destinies are determined by our decisions, our lives shaped by our choices.
Who we are and where we want to go determine what we do and what we accomplish.

### Happiness on purpose
Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment. 
Five factors that contribute to our happiness: positive emotion and pleasure, achievement, relationships, engagement, and meaning. 
When our daily actions fulfill a bigger purpose, the most powerful and enduring happiness can happen. 
Financially wealthy people are those who have enough money coming in without having to work to finance their purpose in life. Without purpose, you’ll never know when you have enough money, and you can never be financially wealthy.

### The power of purpose
Purpose is the straightest path to power and the ultimate source of personal strength —strength of conviction and strength to persevere. When you have a definite purpose for your life, clarity comes faster, which leads to more conviction in your direction, which usually leads to faster decisions. Sticking with something long enough for success to show up is a fundamental requirement for achieving extra-ordinary results.

When what you do matches your purpose, your life just feels in rhythm, and the path you beat with your feet seems to match the sound in your head and heart. “What’s the ONE Thing I can do in my life that would mean the most to me and the world, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?”

**Big Ideas**: Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment. Discover your Big Why. Absent an answer, pick a direction.

## 14. Live by Priority
Live with purpose and you know where you want to go. Live by priority and you’ll know what to do to get there.

### GOAL SETTING TO THE NOW
Purpose has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to. **Purpose without priority is powerless.**
priority remained unpluralized until around the 20th century. While we may pull from the past and forecast the future, our only reality is the present moment.
The truth about success is that our ability to achieve extraordinary results in the future lies in stringing together powerful moments, one after the other.
*hyperbolic discounting*: the further away a reward is in the future, the smaller the immediate motivation to achieve it.

By thinking through the filter of Goal Setting to the Now, you set a future goal and then methodically drill down to what you should be doing right now.

Future purpose connects to the present priority: `GOAL: some day -> 5 years -> 1 year -> Monthly -> Weekly -> Daily -> RIGHT NOW`  
You’re learning how to think big—but go small.

People tend to be overly optimistic about what they can accomplish, and therefore most don’t think things all the way through. Researchers call this the “planning fallacy” Visualizing the process—breaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it—helps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results. This is why Goal Setting to the Now really works.

Your last step is to write down your answers. Much has been written about writing down goals and for a very good reason—it works.

## 15. Live for Productivity
Productive action transforms lives. Putting together a life of extraordinary results simply comes down to getting the most out of what you do, when what you do matters.
At time-managing system’s success can be judged by the productivity it produces.
The most successful people are the most productive people.
Productive people get more done, achieve better results, and earn far more in their hours than the rest. They do so because they devote maximum time to being productive on their top priority, their ONE Thing.

### TIME BLOCKING
Most people think there’s never enough time to be successful, but there is when you block it. Time blocking is a very results-oriented way of viewing and using time. It’s a way of making sure that what has to be done gets done.

`The productive day = 50% Your ONE Thing + 50% Everything Else`
1. Time block your time off: Everything needs rest to function better. Resting is as important as working.
2. Time block your ONE Thing: The most productive people work on event time.
3. Time block your planning time: Block an hour each week to review your annual and monthly goals.

Theere is magic in knocking down your most important domino day after day. All you have to do is avoid breaking the chain, one day at a time, until you generate a powerful new habit in your life: the time-blocking habit.

### PROTECT YOUR TIME BLOCK
it’s your job to protect your time blocks from all those who don’t know what matters most to you, and from yourself when you forget.
The best way to protect your time blocks is to adopt the mindset that they can’t be moved.
The last thing that can knock you off your time block is when you can’t free your mind.

> What’s the ONE Thing I can do to protect my time block every day such by doing it everything else I might do will be easier or unnecessary?

## 16. The Three Commitments
Achieving extraordinary results through time blocking requires three commitments.
First, you must adopt the mindset of someone seeking mastery. Mastery is a commitment to becoming your best, so to achieve extraordinary results you must embrace the extraordinary effort it represents. 
Second, you must continually seek the very best ways of doing things. Nothing is more futile than doing your best using an approach that can’t deliver results equal to your effort. 
And last, you must be willing to be held accountable to doing everything you can to achieve your ONE Thing. Live these commitments and you give yourself a fighting chance to experience extraordinary

**THE THREE COMMITMENTS TO YOUR ONE THING**

### 1. FOLLOW THE PATH OF MASTERY
mastery actually means you’re a master of what you know and an apprentice of what you don’t.
The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance: the 10,000-hour rule. Is about average four hours a day, in 250 workdays a year, per 10 years.
More than anything else, expertise tracks with hours invested. Time on a task, over time, eventually beats talent every time.
When you commit to time block your ONE Thing, make sure you approach it with a mastery mentality. Its serves as a platform for, and speeds up the process of, doing other things. Knowledge begets knowledge and skills build on skills.

### 2. MOVE FROM “E” TO “P”
The path of mastering something is the combination of not only doing the best you can do at it, but also doing it the best it can be done.
Continually improving how you do something is critical to getting the most from time blocking.
Highly productive people don’t accept the limitations of their natural approach as the final word on their success. When they hit a ceiling of achievement, they look for new models and systems, better ways to do things to push them through. They pause just long enough to examine their options, they pick the best one, and then they’re right back at it. Ask an “E” to cut some firewood and the Entrepreneurial person would likely shoulder an axe and head straight for the woods. On the other hand, the Purposeful person might ask, “Where can I get a chainsaw?” With a “P” mindset, you can achieve breakthroughs and accomplish things far beyond your natural abilities.

> The purposeful approach: Doing what comes unnaturally
> 1. Focus, 2. Models, 3. Systems, 4. Breakthroughs.

“a different result requires doing something different.” Make this your mantra and breakthroughs become possible.

When “E” is our only approach, we create artificial limits to what we can achieve and who we can become. When we think we’ve maxed out our potential in a situation, starting over is how we think we’ll get ahead. The problem is this becomes a vicious cycle of taking on the next new thing with renewed enthusiasm, energy, natural ability, and effort, until another ceiling is hit and disappointment and resignation set in once again. Bring “P” to the same ceiling and things look different. The Purposeful approach says, “I’m still committed to growing, so what are my options?” Implementing these may require new thinking, new skills, and even new relationships. Probably none of this will feel natural at first.

When you’ve done the best you can do but are certain the results aren’t the best they can be, get out of “E” and into “P.” Look for the better models and systems, the ways that can take you farther. Then adopt new thinking, new skills, and new relationships to help you put them into action.

### 3. LIVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY CYCLE
There is an undeniable connection between what you do and what you get. Actions determine outcomes, and outcomes inform actions.
Accountable people are results oriented and never defend actions, skill levels, models, systems, or relationships that just aren’t getting the job done. They see outcomes as information they can use to frame better actions to get better outcomes.
Peak a coach or a mentor as an accountability partner.

> individuals with written goals were 39.5 percent more likely to succeed. Individuals who wrote their goals and sent progress reports to friends were 76.7 percent more likely to achieve them.

## 17. The Four Thieves

### 1. INABILITY TO SAY “NO”
One “yes” must be defended over time by 1,000 “nos.”
When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to. In the end, the best way to succeed big is to go small. And when you go small, you say no—a lot.

> No one knew how to go small better than Steve Jobs. He was famously as proud of the products he didn’t pursue as he was of the transformative products Apple created. In the two years after his return in 1997, he took the company from 350 products to ten.

The rule is simple: A request must be connected to my ONE Thing for me to consider it.

### 2. FEAR OF CHAOS
There will always be people and projects that simply aren’t a part of your biggest single priority but still matter. You will feel them pressing for your attention.
When you strive for greatness, chaos is guaranteed to show up.
Move past your fear of chaos, learn to deal with it, and trust that your work on your ONE Thing will come through for you.

### 3. POOR HEALTH HABITS
Personal energy mismanagement is a silent thief of productivity.
High achievement and extraordinary results require big energy. The trick is learning how to get it and keep it:
- Meditation
- breaksfat, healthy food
- emotional energy
- Set goals, plan, and calendar for mental energy. 
- eight hours of sleep. When you’ve connected proper sleep with success, you’ll have a good enough reason to get up and you’ll go to sleep at the right time.

when you spend the early hours energizing yourself, you get pulled through the rest of the day with little additional effort. You’re not focused on having a perfect day all day, but on **having an energized start to each day**. That’s positive energy creating positive momentum.

### 4. ENVIRONMENT DOESN’T SUPPORT YOUR GOALS
Your environment is simply who you see and what you experience every day.
No one lives or works in isolation. Every day, throughout your day, you come in contact with others and are influenced by them. It’s a fact that you’re likely to pick up some of the attitudes of others. Being with success-minded people creates what researchers call a “positive spiral of success” where they lift you up and send you on your way.

Create a productivity-specific environment to support your ONE Thing: people + place.

The people we see tend to set our standard for what’s appropriate. In time, you begin to think, act, and even look a little like those you hang out with. But not only do their attitudes and health habits influence you, their relative success does too.

> No one succeeds alone and no one fails alone. Pay attention to the people around you.

When your physical environment isn’t in step with your goals, it can also keep you from ever getting started on them in the first place.

## 18. The Journey
Extraordinary results require you to go small.
Getting your focus as small as possible simplifies your thinking and crystallizes what you must do.
You must survey your choices, narrow your options, line up your priorities, and do what matters most. You must go small. You must find your ONE Thing.
Actions build on action. Habits build on habit. Success builds on success. Whenever you want extraordinary results, look for the levered action that will start a domino run for you.
Big lives ride the powerful wave of chain reactions and are built sequentially, which means when you’re aiming for success you can’t just skip to the end.

### ADVICE FROM A FRIEND

> “Go live your life. Live it fully, without fear. Live with purpose, give it your all, and never give up.” Effort is important, for without it you will never succeed at your highest level. Achievement is important, for without it you will never experience your true potential. Pursuing purpose is important, for unless you do, you may never find lasting happiness. Step out on faith that these things are true. Go live a life worth living

**live your life to minimize the regrets you might have at the end.**

The Top Five Regrets of the Dying:
1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me
2. I wish that I’d let myself be happier
3. wish I’d stayed in touch with my friends
4. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings
5. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard

> “When people look back on their lives, it is the things they have not done that generate the greatest regret.... People’s actions may be troublesome initially; it is their inactions that plague them most with long-term feelings of regret.”

### SUCCESS IS AN INSIDE JOB
So, how do you live a life of no regrets? The same way your journey to extraordinary results begins. With purpose, priority, and productivity.
All success in life starts within you. You know what to do. You know how to do it. Your next step is simple.
You are the first domino.
