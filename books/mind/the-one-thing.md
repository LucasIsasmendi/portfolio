## 4. Everything Matters Equally


## 10. The Focusing Question

> And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun on one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it. “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” is all wrong.- Carnegie.

The Focusing Question helps keep your first step from being a misstep. The quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question. Questions engage our critical thinking. To get the answers we seek, we have to invent the right questions.

The Focusing Question: **What is the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?**

The Focusing Question can lead you to answer not only “big picture” questions (Where am I going? What target should I aim for?) but also “small focus” ones as well (What must I do right now to be on the path to getting the big picture? Where’s the bull’s-eye?).
It tells you not only what your basket should be, but also the first step toward getting it.
It’s both a map for the big picture and a compass for your smallest next move.
Each time you ask it, you see your next priority

- Great questions are the path to great answers.
- big picture and small focus. One is about finding the right direction in life and the other is about finding the right action.

## 11. The Success Habit
When we start and continue a way of thinking or a way of acting over a long enough period, we’ve created a new habit. The choice we face is whether or not we want to form habits that get us what we want from life. If we do, then the Focusing Question is the most powerful success habit we can have.

Do it again and again until all dominoes are lined up: Over time, you’ll develop your own sense of when to use the big-picture question and when to use the small-focus question.

The Focusing Question can direct you to your ONE Thing in the different areas of your life. Simply reframe the Focusing Question by inserting your area of focus. You can also include a time frame—such as “right now” or “this year”—to give your answer the appropriate level of immediacy, or “in five years” or “someday” to find a big-picture answer that points you at outcomes to aim for.

**Big Ideas**: Understand and believe it. Use it. Make it a habit. Leverage reminders. Recruit support.

## 12. The Path to Great Answers
You ask a great question, then you seek out a great answer. Great questions, like great goals, are big and specific. They push you, stretch you, and aim you at big, specific answers. And because they’re framed to be measurable, there’s no wiggle room about what the results will look like.

### 1. Ask a Great Question: Four Quadrants
- Quadrant 4. Small & Specific: What can I do to increase sales by 5 percent this year?”
- Quadrant 3. Small & Broad: “What can I do to increase sales?”
- Quadrant 2. Big & Broad: “What can I do to double sales?”
- Quadrant 1. Big & Specific: “What can I do to double sales in six months?”
=> FQ: ”What’s the ONE Thing I can do to double sales in six months such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”

### 2. Find a Great Answer
Answers come in three categories: 
- doable: you already know it
- stretch: research and study
- and possibility: beyond what is already known and being done. Research, model, benchmark (max from strech), and trend (what comes next) experience from people that already done that path. You’re not the first person to dream big, so you’d be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons.

The benchmark is today’s success—the trend is tomorrow’s.
Benchmarking and trending is your best option. Because your answer will be original, you’ll probably have to reinvent yourself in some way to implement it. A new answer usually requires new behavior,

**Big Ideas**: Think big and specific. Think posibilities. [***]Benchmark and trend for the best answer.


**Part 3 - Extraordinary Results: Unlocking the Possibilities Within You**
There is a natural rhythm to our lives that becomes a simple formula for implementing the ONE Thing and achieving extraordinary results: purpose, priority, and productivity.
In business, profit and productivity are also driven by priority and purpose.

## 13. Live with Purpose
Our destinies are determined by our decisions, our lives shaped by our choices.
Who we are and where we want to go determine what we do and what we accomplish.

### Happiness on purpose
Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment. 
Five factors that contribute to our happiness: positive emotion and pleasure, achievement, relationships, engagement, and meaning. 
When our daily actions fulfill a bigger purpose, the most powerful and enduring happiness can happen. 
Financially wealthy people are those who have enough money coming in without having to work to finance their purpose in life. Without purpose, you’ll never know when you have enough money, and you can never be financially wealthy.

### The power of purpose
Purpose is the straightest path to power and the ultimate source of personal strength —strength of conviction and strength to persevere. When you have a definite purpose for your life, clarity comes faster, which leads to more conviction in your direction, which usually leads to faster decisions. Sticking with something long enough for success to show up is a fundamental requirement for achieving extra-ordinary results.

When what you do matches your purpose, your life just feels in rhythm, and the path you beat with your feet seems to match the sound in your head and heart. “What’s the ONE Thing I can do in my life that would mean the most to me and the world, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?”

**Big Ideas**: Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment. Discover your Big Why. Absent an answer, pick a direction.

## 14. Live by Priority
Live with purpose and you know where you want to go. Live by priority and you’ll know what to do to get there.

### GOAL SETTING TO THE NOW
Purpose has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to. **Purpose without priority is powerless.**
priority remained unpluralized until around the 20th century. While we may pull from the past and forecast the future, our only reality is the present moment.
The truth about success is that our ability to achieve extraordinary results in the future lies in stringing together powerful moments, one after the other.
*hyperbolic discounting*: the further away a reward is in the future, the smaller the immediate motivation to achieve it.

By thinking through the filter of Goal Setting to the Now, you set a future goal and then methodically drill down to what you should be doing right now.

Future purpose connects to the present priority: `GOAL: some day -> 5 years -> 1 year -> Monthly -> Weekly -> Daily -> RIGHT NOW`  
You’re learning how to think big—but go small.

People tend to be overly optimistic about what they can accomplish, and therefore most don’t think things all the way through. Researchers call this the “planning fallacy” Visualizing the process—breaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it—helps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results. This is why Goal Setting to the Now really works.

Your last step is to write down your answers. Much has been written about writing down goals and for a very good reason—it works.
