Traditional techniques associated with speed-reading: http://effortless-reading.com/resources.

Nail It Then Scale It: “Most entrepreneurs fail because they do the right thing, but in the wrong ORDER.”

Reading one idea, in one book, at the right time, in the proper context, has a much greater impact than reading ten books at an unrelated time.

### ch1 What is your why?

Avoid default reading mode, so keep in mind your **WHY** while going through the book.

Don’t be black and white about what to read or not read, meaning don’t either read something to the end or not read it at all.

> "You should stand on the shoulder of the giant, and not waste your life figuring out things that have already been figured out. Trials can be costly in terms of time, and too much error is deadly"

> "the greatest skill you can have is the ability to get through the materials quickly."

### ch2 - Your Reading cheat sheet

- When to read?: You should read every day. The best time is in the morning before breakfast (heavy reading) and in the evening, after dinner (easy to digest books).
- How much time do you need? 10 to 15 minutes
- How you should position yourself? sitting is not part of the natural physiology of the human body. Lie down and put your feet up on a chair, so that your legs are parallel to the ground.
  - The first step is to ask: What is my end goal in reading this book? Reading needs to start with an intention. Start by reading the book jacket. Learn more about the author and unblock your authority bias (brain filter).
  - Next, read the table of contents. Read the introduction and skim through the first chapter. Then figure out which chapter will most likely fulfill what you are trying to acquire: dive deeply into it at your own comfortable pace. Mark relevant ideas.
  - After the time is up and you’ve finished the chapter you wanted to read—let the book go.
  - In the table of contents, check off the chapter you read. If you haven’t already, start a book list, recording all the titles you’ve read/passed through. Remember—maintaining a list of books is critical to track and form your reading habits.

  The first aspect, “understanding your strength and your situation,” is crucial in determining when to read, how to position yourself, and your overall goal for reading a particular book. From the second aspect, the “gold miner mindset” and the “one thing principle” come into play when you annotate the book and choose the most relevant chapter to read that will address the one big question that you seek an answer to. The final aspect, “building your reading habit around your situation, goal, and available cognition,” encapsulates the whole process from start to finish.

### ch3 Reading myths

#### Myth #1: What book do you recommend I read?
Often, people unintentionally give recommendation without knowing much about the asker’s true motive. Perhaps a better question to ask is, “I’m trying to learn about [_]. What do you recommend I read?”. Not having any reading activity is unwise. But reading the wrong book is even worse. I would rather not read any book than read the wrong book.

##### Know where you are first

> All of that advice and knowledge are all correct; we are all on the same map—just in different places. While it is important to know where you want to go, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know who you are (strengths, needs) or even where you are.

It is critical not only which book you read, but equally so, which book you choose NOT to read. Every time you read the right book, it puts you a little bit ahead of the game. For every wrong book you read, whether wrong type, wrong timing, or wrong order, your reading practice suffers some damage.

Your goal is to read as much of the right ones as possible and to avoid the wrong ones. That way you are getting ahead of the game fast enough to build permanent momentum, before you stack up enough damage and give up on your reading.

#### Myth #2: Mastering speed-reading is necessary.

When the speed goes up, unfortunately, information retention is not improved at the same rate.
Time is not the only resource needed for reading. You consume a good amount of willpower, concentration, and logical thinking while you read, and they are not refilled as fast as you can speed-read.

> The human brain has no choice but to adapt by developing a filter system, one that filters more than 99% of that information and only keeps the most relevant pieces.

Most of the time during speed-reading, the brain has to play a catch-up game, which it is terrible at and usually loses. 
The observed symptom is to feel sleepy while reading. The larger the gap between the speed of the eyes and the brain, the faster it feels tired.

Speed-reading is just an optional enhancement.

#### Myth #3: You better read the whole book.

Once an act of commitment is made, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand; and it can bias us toward subsequent consistent choices.
Without understanding commitment bias, people read books from chapter to chapter thinking they read them because the content is good. Not all the chapters in a book matter equally.

Your goal should be the driver of your reading. It should guide you in making the decision about which chapters you read, rather than letting the commitment bias take over, causing you to read the whole book.

**Dark side of the authors** they can introduce fluff because they need to reach some amounts of words.

### ch4 Deliberated reading aspect 1: selective focus

Selective focus is the practice of choosing the right book to read. 
Selective focus is achieved by being aware of and following two ideas: 
1. You need to know your strengths, weaknesses, and current situation. 
2. Then, you focus all your energy on solving your number one problem by leveraging your strengths.

#### The Art of Self-Management

> "Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at"

Do you know what your strengths are?
Can your strengths fill in the gap and help you move to the next desired stage?

The first step in the process is to master the “3 Knows-Knows.”

#### The 3 Know-Knows

##### Know Your Strengths
You can use personality tests: Myers-Briggs Types Indicators (MBTI), Strength Finder, and Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic learning styles, etc. (check resources).

One factor to finding the right book is to understand how much your strengths align with the author’s strengths.

##### Know Your Stage
What’s your current finance stage? Where are you at with your career? Being aware of the context as well as your situation filters out inapplicable books.

##### Know Your Problem
Every day, people have to deal with different aspects of life, typically including health, wealth, relationships, or happiness. Any of these areas could have ups and downs.

However, if you pay close attention to your thoughts, you will realize the majority of the time you are thinking about only one problem—the most impactful one and also the most uncomfortable one. It is typically the one that you most procrastinate about, and it scares you the most. Can you identify what it is and how it was formed?

#### The One Thing (read the book!)

(1) What’s the ONE THING I can do, (2) such that by doing it, (3) everything else will be easier or unnecessary?

It is an extremely powerful approach to living your life. Basically, you boost one area so ridiculously high that it could outweigh and rewrite the meaning of all other things.

> “In business we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few variables.”

The principle operates the same way in choosing the book to read.

Once you have executed the first part of selective focus, you should know what is that “one thing” you need to take on. If done right, you are not only aware of that one thing, but you also understand well the context around it and whether you have the necessary skills to get it done. This becomes the criteria to choose your next book.

**Solve your number one problem first.**

### ch5 - Deliberated reading aspect 2: Repetition
> You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. What I have learned is to make sure I carefully choose whom I want to spend time with.

> “Five years from today, you will be the same person that you are today, except for the books you read and the people you meet.”

> It isn’t the friendship itself that brings us joy and contentment; it’s what we take from (and give to) it.

Don’t be afraid to stop reading a book that you don’t feel strongly about and start spending more time reading repeatedly the best books you have. I read my 150 best books of all times repeatedly

**The second component of deliberated reading is not volume, but repetition.**

Making a friend is a process. It takes many rounds and events to get to know one person thoroughly. The same thinking should be applied to reading.

Reading a book in one full pass and trying to apply all its concepts has the same level of risk as releasing a full-fledged product in one shot. The recommended way is to go through it in multiple passes, starting with learning the most important concepts and then expanding to more details in future re-readings.

Repetition forms a deep relationship between you and the book. Only then, it can start casting its effects into your daily life. Biologically speaking, reading contributes to the brain’s ability to connect and integrate various sources of information—especially, visual with auditory, linguistic, and conceptual areas.

#### Adding the repetition factor to reading
To start coordinating repetition into your reading, keep a list of the best 50 to 150 books that you will return to and reread every year.

Over time, your situations, focus, and interests in life might change. Allow yourself to remove it from the list or replace the book with a better one. Repeat the process until the point you can proudly introduce those books to your peers.

Schedule your reading to balance between reading new books and rereading those 150.

Tools to help track those books: Offline Document, Online Document, Book Platform Service.

choose books with **selective focus** and make friends with books by practicing **repetition**.

### ch6 - Deliberated Reading aspect 3: Balance

> "You cannot build a dream on a foundation of sand. To weather the test of storms, it must be cemented in the heart with uncompromising conviction."

As you read books about tactics, you need to ensure you spend time on upgrading your philosophy to match the tactics level as well.

#### Deliberate reading works when the balance is in motion
More often, people do not know that reading must keep up with the multiple latitudes of life.

Distribute your reading among the following categories:
1. Classic Books: Their authors are often the great thinkers of the century (Seneca, Aristotle, or Karl Marx).
2. How-To or “Tactics” Books: go straight to the point, easy-to-consume format, provides new skill or steps to perform certain tasks, up-to-date knowledge, short life-spans
3. Autobiographies and Biographies: Not only do you learn how to obtain a particular skill set, but studying their stories also equips you with great lessons you can’t find anywhere else. By seeing other extraordinary people handle fear and accomplish the same thing that you are trying to do, you will be able to build up your courage and inspiration to do the same.

As you choose which book to read, try to distribute evenly among the three types.
By understanding the purpose of the three types, your reading will benefit from being balanced between tactics, philosophy, and modeling.

**Defuse your mind for a good night's sleep**
By switching to a relaxed state, your sleep can come to you more easily and get deeper: Fiction, Autobiographies and biographies.

### ch7 - Deliberated reading aspect 4: Getting in the Right Gear
Getting into the right gear puts you, the reader, into the optimal setting to consume the material effortlessly.

Reading, in many ways, resembles driving on the road: you learn not to speed in the cities because it’s dangerous. You also learn that driving slowly on the highway is as dangerous as racing in the cities.

It is harmful to use the same reading speed to handle different types of books.

In reading, “crashes” happen when your reading speed does not align with the type of book you’re reading. The symptoms of a reading crash include feeling sleepy after a short time, the inability to retain or to link together the information, getting lost in the big picture, or diving too deeply into the story without learning any lesson.

Different types of books demand different “gears” and speeds.

#### The How To, Tactics Books - Gear 3 - Light Willpower Required
Entails the easiest type of reading. You should be able to read it at the fastest speed possible. These books are straightforward and easy to digest. You can find high recurrences of the same central ideas.

Key: just chill, and come back to it at a later time when you have the need for more information.

#### The Classic Book - Gear 2 - High Willpower Required
Are designed to be read at a moderate pace. They demand more attention. You should allow more time to understand them and to reflect upon your own experience while reading them. Some classic books also require preparation.

Classics often contain more than one gold nugget, typically around 5–10. Sometimes they compliment each other and form a “framework,” so it is necessary to go both broad and deep here.

For the first book pass, familiarize yourself with at least a one-sentence description of all the fundamental principles in the book. Then pick (only) ONE of the principles to dive deeply into. 

Read early in the morning.

#### The Autobiography or Biography - Gear 1 - Easy Reading
Lowest gear. You need to understand your end game goal. Tone is highly entertaining and engaging (like fiction). It’s not recommended to jump ahead and skip a few chapters.

Depending on where you are in your life, you might have more interest in the starter phase (the discovery phase) or the heroic one (when the subject takes bold actions and conquers the greatest challenges).

To extend your vision and comfort zone beyond your current circumstances. As a result, you shall find your own uncertainty regarding an upcoming challenge reduced as your courage increases, helps you make better decisions and to bypass the fear of failure.

Your pace of reading needs to be moderate.

From major events, your goal is to understand:
- The context or situation that the subject was in 
- The surrounding human factors, especially the subject’s relationships with those around.
- The strengths and limitations of the subject at that time, including knowledge, finances, physical being, and mental state

By feeding a virtual “history” to your brain, it will trigger hormone creation, producing necessary dopamine to drive a particular action. In other words, it will grant you quick access to higher levels of possibility.

**Control your Gear**
The recommended reading paces in this chapter should be used as initial guidance rather than highly strict guidelines in your reading.

Selective focus, repetition, balance, and speed are the four components that make up deliberated reading. Review them frequently in your multiple passes through this book—and apply them always, no matter what text you are reading.

The following two chapters will provide you with handy tools to ease your management of that knowledge. Without these tools, your knowledge may become scattered and too weak to deliver the desired results.

### Ch8 - Reading Routine

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. - Aristotle

Reading is considerably one of the hardest habits to form, high failure rate. Though it can take years to form the habit, it only takes a few days to break the chain and lose it.

#### Keys to Developing a successful reading routine
1. **Determine the amount of time you can devote to reading:** Start small—only 10-15 minutes every day and do not exceed 45 minutes. Reading should be a daily activity, not a one-day burst. 3 times a day: classic books at morning. How-to, “tactics” books at afternoon. End of day autobiography or biography.
2. **Set a goal, and plan your reading.** Anything that gets planned, gets done. Write down your reading goals for the year, divide it into monthly goals, and also plan your reading for each week. New books + re-reading.
3. **Track your progress, and curate your master knowledge list.**:  Aside from the list of books to be read, you should maintain three other lists:
   - books you have read (title - author)
   - favorite books (ranked, reordered)
   - subjects, including what you have learned, significant quotations, and book names related to subjects.

Goodreads, Shelfari, and LibraryThing are platforms that help maintain your reading list as well as social connections around reading

### ch9 - Annotation code
Successful people compile and maintain their master list of topics and principles.

#### How do you build your list?: with a Good Annotation code system
I = idea derived from what I am reading.
K.Q. = Key quote. Add then into a list of master quotes (organized by theme), reread
P = Plot. Crucial points in the plot.
S = Style. Sentences and passages

Another code system, from Timothy Kenny, the author of Accelerated Learning for Entrepreneurs:
A = take action on this
B = book to read
P = Person
Q = quote
? = I don't understand
important = *
really important = **
life changing = ***

**create your annotation system**

### ch10 - The future of Books
Readers who can leverage the latest services on the Internet can enhance their learning, cut off years of trial and error, and get ahead of others.
By understanding how knowledge is spread and the latest convenient ways to accumulate knowledge, you will start getting ahead of the game.
The most dramatic change in our global knowledge is about to occur between 2016 and 2020. Three to five billion learners, people who have never created or consumed any digital information, are about to go online and provide a mega-surge to the available global knowledge.

I revealed the three myths that can put an end to years of wasteful reading. We then went deep into the better approach—deliberated reading. By incorporating all four aspects—selective focus, repetition, balance, and getting in the right gear—you can turn reading into your secret recipe for reaching the top—and staying there.
