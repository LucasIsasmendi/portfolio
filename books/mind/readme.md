Nail It Then Scale It: “Most entrepreneurs fail because they do the right thing, but in the wrong ORDER.”

Reading one idea, in one book, at the right time, in the proper context, has a much greater impact than reading ten books at an unrelated time.

### ch1 What is your why?

Avoid default reading mode, so keep in mind your **WHY** while going through the book.

Don’t be black and white about what to read or not read, meaning don’t either read something to the end or not read it at all.

> "You should stand on the shoulder of the giant, and not waste your life figuring out things that have already been figured out. Trials can be costly in terms of time, and too much error is deadly"

> "the greatest skill you can have is the ability to get through the materials quickly."

### ch2 - Your Reading cheat sheet

- When to read?: You should read every day. The best time is in the morning before breakfast (heavy reading) and in the evening, after dinner (easy to digest books).
- How much time do you need? 10 to 15 minutes
- How you should position yourself? sitting is not part of the natural physiology of the human body. Lie down and put your feet up on a chair, so that your legs are parallel to the ground.
  - The first step is to ask: What is my end goal in reading this book? Reading needs to start with an intention. Start by reading the book jacket. Learn more about the author and unblock your authority bias (brain filter).
  - Next, read the table of contents. Read the introduction and skim through the first chapter. Then figure out which chapter will most likely fulfill what you are trying to acquire: dive deeply into it at your own comfortable pace. Mark relevant ideas.
  - After the time is up and you’ve finished the chapter you wanted to read—let the book go.
  - In the table of contents, check off the chapter you read. If you haven’t already, start a book list, recording all the titles you’ve read/passed through. Remember—maintaining a list of books is critical to track and form your reading habits.

  The first aspect, “understanding your strength and your situation,” is crucial in determining when to read, how to position yourself, and your overall goal for reading a particular book. From the second aspect, the “gold miner mindset” and the “one thing principle” come into play when you annotate the book and choose the most relevant chapter to read that will address the one big question that you seek an answer to. The final aspect, “building your reading habit around your situation, goal, and available cognition,” encapsulates the whole process from start to finish.

### ch3 Reading myths

#### Myth #1: What book do you recommend I read?
Often, people unintentionally give recommendation without knowing much about the asker’s true motive. Perhaps a better question to ask is, “I’m trying to learn about [_]. What do you recommend I read?”. Not having any reading activity is unwise. But reading the wrong book is even worse. I would rather not read any book than read the wrong book.

##### Know where you are first

> All of that advice and knowledge are all correct; we are all on the same map—just in different places. While it is important to know where you want to go, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know who you are (strengths, needs) or even where you are.

It is critical not only which book you read, but equally so, which book you choose NOT to read. Every time you read the right book, it puts you a little bit ahead of the game. For every wrong book you read, whether wrong type, wrong timing, or wrong order, your reading practice suffers some damage.

Your goal is to read as much of the right ones as possible and to avoid the wrong ones. That way you are getting ahead of the game fast enough to build permanent momentum, before you stack up enough damage and give up on your reading.

#### Myth #2: Mastering speed-reading is necessary.

When the speed goes up, unfortunately, information retention is not improved at the same rate.
Time is not the only resource needed for reading. You consume a good amount of willpower, concentration, and logical thinking while you read, and they are not refilled as fast as you can speed-read.

> The human brain has no choice but to adapt by developing a filter system, one that filters more than 99% of that information and only keeps the most relevant pieces.

Most of the time during speed-reading, the brain has to play a catch-up game, which it is terrible at and usually loses. 
The observed symptom is to feel sleepy while reading. The larger the gap between the speed of the eyes and the brain, the faster it feels tired.

Speed-reading is just an optional enhancement.

#### Myth #3: You better read the whole book.

Once an act of commitment is made, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand; and it can bias us toward subsequent consistent choices.
Without understanding commitment bias, people read books from chapter to chapter thinking they read them because the content is good. Not all the chapters in a book matter equally.

Your goal should be the driver of your reading. It should guide you in making the decision about which chapters you read, rather than letting the commitment bias take over, causing you to read the whole book.

**Dark side of the authors** they can introduce fluff because they need to reach some amounts of words.

### ch4 Deliberated reading aspect 1: selective focus

Selective focus is the practice of choosing the right book to read. 
Selective focus is achieved by being aware of and following two ideas: 
1. You need to know your strengths, weaknesses, and current situation. 
2. Then, you focus all your energy on solving your number one problem by leveraging your strengths.

#### The Art of Self-Management

> "Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. More often, people know what they are not good at"

Do you know what your strengths are?
Can your strengths fill in the gap and help you move to the next desired stage?

The first step in the process is to master the “3 Knows-Knows.”

#### The 3 Know-Knows

##### Know Your Strengths
You can use personality tests: Myers-Briggs Types Indicators (MBTI), Strength Finder, and Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic learning styles, etc. (check resources).

One factor to finding the right book is to understand how much your strengths align with the author’s strengths.

##### Know Your Stage
What’s your current finance stage? Where are you at with your career? Being aware of the context as well as your situation filters out inapplicable books.

##### Know Your Problem
Every day, people have to deal with different aspects of life, typically including health, wealth, relationships, or happiness. Any of these areas could have ups and downs.

However, if you pay close attention to your thoughts, you will realize the majority of the time you are thinking about only one problem—the most impactful one and also the most uncomfortable one. It is typically the one that you most procrastinate about, and it scares you the most. Can you identify what it is and how it was formed?

#### The One Thing (read the book!)

(1) What’s the ONE THING I can do, (2) such that by doing it, (3) everything else will be easier or unnecessary?

It is an extremely powerful approach to living your life. Basically, you boost one area so ridiculously high that it could outweigh and rewrite the meaning of all other things.

> “In business we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few variables.”

The principle operates the same way in choosing the book to read.

Once you have executed the first part of selective focus, you should know what is that “one thing” you need to take on. If done right, you are not only aware of that one thing, but you also understand well the context around it and whether you have the necessary skills to get it done. This becomes the criteria to choose your next book.

**Solve your number one problem first.**
