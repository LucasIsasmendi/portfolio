## Intro
Do you feel that despite your best efforts, you are not performing at your best? More than ever we are under constant pressure to succeed.
To thrive in this breakneck environment, our best bet is to leverage our most powerful assets: our internal resources. We need to think smarter, make better decisions, relate more strongly to others, work brilliantly, and manage our stress.

We wrote this book with two goals in mind: to make the best, most rigorous research findings on the science of success and fulfillment accessible to everyone and to help you apply these insights so you can effect radical change in your life as quickly as possible.

When your mind is fit, you get more out of life, more out of work, more out of your relationships, more out of everything.

## Reset Your Mind
Is my mind conspiring against me—creating negative thoughts around innocuous situations or unrealistically positive thoughts around truly negative situations?

> we all choose how we think, react, and respond to situations.

Being stuck in autopilot can not only lead you down the wrong paths, it can also result in fantastic opportunities passing you by.
You’ll also learn how and when to flip the switch on habits, keeping the good habits and eliminating the bad.
