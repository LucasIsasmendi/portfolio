# Atomic Habits
What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.

The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.
In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can rely on year after year.

**Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal,** is one of the core themes of this book. Atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results, components of the system of compound growth.

## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Strategy “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

### Why small habits make a big difference
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.

The effects of small habits compound over time: 
- `1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03`
- `1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78`

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. It is only whargs[0]en looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

**Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.** What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. **You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.**

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. **You get what you repeat**.

### Your Habits can compound for you or against you
**Positive Compound**:
- Productivity compounds: The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
- Knowledge compounds: commitment to lifelong learning
- Relationships compound: Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.

**Negative Compound**:
- Stress compounds: over years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.
- Negative thoughts compound: You get trapped in a thought loop
- Outrage compounds

### What Progress is Really Like
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. 
Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. **Mastery requires patience.**

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed.

### Forget About Goals, Focus on Systems Instead
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change: you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness: The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

### A System of Atomic Habits
If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Why is it so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
Once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
- **outcomes**: changing results (losing weight, goals) -> GET
- **process**: changing habits and systems (new routine at the gym, meditation practice) -> DO
- **identity**: changing beliefs, assumptions (worlview, self-image, judgments) -> BELIEVE

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on **who we wish to become**.
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say **I’m the type of person who is this**.

**The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.** 
True behavior change is identity change. 
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are: *The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.*

Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse: *I’m terrible with directions. I’m not a morning person.*
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it, even if it’s wrong. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.**

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
1. Decide the type of person you want to be. (This holds at any level): “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Each experience in life modifies your self-image. 
The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

Feedback loops: your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER
Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The true question is: **“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?”**. You need to know who you want to be. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. You become your habits.
