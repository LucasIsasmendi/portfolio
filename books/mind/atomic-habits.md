# Atomic Habits
What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.

The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.
In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can rely on year after year.

**Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal,** is one of the core themes of this book. Atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results, components of the system of compound growth.

## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Strategy “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

### Why small habits make a big difference
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.

The effects of small habits compound over time: 
- `1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03`
- `1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78`

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. It is only whargs[0]en looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

**Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.** What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. **You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.**

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. **You get what you repeat**.

### Your Habits can compound for you or against you
**Positive Compound**:
- Productivity compounds: The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
- Knowledge compounds: commitment to lifelong learning
- Relationships compound: Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.

**Negative Compound**:
- Stress compounds: over years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.
- Negative thoughts compound: You get trapped in a thought loop
- Outrage compounds

### What Progress is Really Like
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. 
Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. **Mastery requires patience.**

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed.

### Forget About Goals, Focus on Systems Instead
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change: you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness: The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

### A System of Atomic Habits
If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Why is it so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
Once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
- **outcomes**: changing results (losing weight, goals) -> GET
- **process**: changing habits and systems (new routine at the gym, meditation practice) -> DO
- **identity**: changing beliefs, assumptions (worlview, self-image, judgments) -> BELIEVE

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on **who we wish to become**.
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say **I’m the type of person who is this**.

**The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.** 
True behavior change is identity change. 
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are: *The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.*

Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse: *I’m terrible with directions. I’m not a morning person.*
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it, even if it’s wrong. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.**

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
1. Decide the type of person you want to be. (This holds at any level): “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Each experience in life modifies your self-image. 
The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

Feedback loops: your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER
Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The true question is: **“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?”**. You need to know who you want to be. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. You become your habits.

## 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”

### WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS
Whenever you encounter a new situation in life: You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action. Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period.
After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.

“Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.

It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

### THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK
steps: cue(noticing) -> craving(wanting) -> response(obtaning) -> reward(satisfaction,learning)
- The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
- Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
- The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.
- Rewards are the end goal of every habit. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.

### THE HABIT LOOP
This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results (Hooked)
- Problem phase: 1. Cue, 2. Craving
- Solution phase: 3. Response, 4. Reward

By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives.

### THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

**How to Create a Good Habit**:
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

**How to Break a Bad Habit**
- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

**The 1st Law: Make It Obvious**

## 4 The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you experience something repeatedly your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous.
Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. 
Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.

### THE HABITS SCORECARD
Pointing-and-Calling is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. Is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level (use all senses).
Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.
Habits Scorecard(+, -, = will depend on your situation and your goals) is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

> TODO: my daily habits scorecard - page 104 example

There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run +/-: Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?
[*] Pointing-and-Calling: Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.

## 5 The Best Way to Start a New Habit
implementation intention: is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. "During PERIOD, I will do ACTION on DAY at TIME in PLACE". The two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world.

### HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS
The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called **habit stacking**.
“After [CURRENT-HABIT], I will [NEW-HABIT]."

Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:
- Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator.
- Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet.
- Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.
One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits
