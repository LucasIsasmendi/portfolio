# Atomic Habits
What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.

The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.
In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can rely on year after year.

**Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal,** is one of the core themes of this book. Atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results, components of the system of compound growth.

## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Strategy “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

### Why small habits make a big difference
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.

The effects of small habits compound over time: 
- `1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03`
- `1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78`

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. It is only whargs[0]en looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.

**Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.** What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. **You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.**

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. **You get what you repeat**.

### Your Habits can compound for you or against you
**Positive Compound**:
- Productivity compounds: The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
- Knowledge compounds: commitment to lifelong learning
- Relationships compound: Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.

**Negative Compound**:
- Stress compounds: over years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.
- Negative thoughts compound: You get trapped in a thought loop
- Outrage compounds

### What Progress is Really Like
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. 
Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. **Mastery requires patience.**

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed.

### Forget About Goals, Focus on Systems Instead
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change: you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness: The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

### A System of Atomic Habits
If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Why is it so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
Once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.

### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
- **outcomes**: changing results (losing weight, goals) -> GET
- **process**: changing habits and systems (new routine at the gym, meditation practice) -> DO
- **identity**: changing beliefs, assumptions (worlview, self-image, judgments) -> BELIEVE

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on **who we wish to become**.
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say **I’m the type of person who is this**.

**The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.** 
True behavior change is identity change. 
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are: *The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.*

Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse: *I’m terrible with directions. I’m not a morning person.*
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it, even if it’s wrong. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.**

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
1. Decide the type of person you want to be. (This holds at any level): “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Each experience in life modifies your self-image. 
The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

Feedback loops: your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

### THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER
Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The true question is: **“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?”**. You need to know who you want to be. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. You become your habits.

## 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”

### WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS
Whenever you encounter a new situation in life: You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action. Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period.
After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.

“Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.

It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.

### THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK
steps: cue(noticing) -> craving(wanting) -> response(obtaning) -> reward(satisfaction,learning)
- The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
- Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
- The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.
- Rewards are the end goal of every habit. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.

### THE HABIT LOOP
This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results (Hooked)
- Problem phase: 1. Cue, 2. Craving
- Solution phase: 3. Response, 4. Reward

By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives.

### THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE
it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

**How to Create a Good Habit**:
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

**How to Break a Bad Habit**
- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

**The 1st Law: Make It Obvious**

## 4 The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you experience something repeatedly your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous.
Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. 
Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.

### THE HABITS SCORECARD
Pointing-and-Calling is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. Is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level (use all senses).
Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.
Habits Scorecard(+, -, = will depend on your situation and your goals) is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

> TODO: my daily habits scorecard - page 104 example

There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run +/-: Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?
[*] Pointing-and-Calling: Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.

## 5 The Best Way to Start a New Habit
implementation intention: is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. "During PERIOD, I will do ACTION on DAY at TIME in PLACE". The two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world.

### HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS
The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called **habit stacking**.
“After [CURRENT-HABIT], I will [NEW-HABIT]."

Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:
- Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator.
- Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet.
- Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.
One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits

> TODO: 2 colum list to find right trigger for habits - page 119

## 6 Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.
Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).

### HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS
If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.

### THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE
The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior (social drink).
We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym.
Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.
You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.
Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.
Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another.
If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones. 

If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these.

## 7 The Secret to Self-Control
spend less time in tempting situations.
Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear.
Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.
Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely

**cut bad habits off at the source**: reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

**The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive**

## 8 How to Make a Habit Irresistible
A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality and it elicits a stronger response than usual.
The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose. French fries: orosensation.
They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.

### THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming is associated with higher levels of dopamine. It plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.
Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.

### THE DOPAMINE SPIKE
Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.

We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place.

### HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE
Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.
Premack’s Principle: **more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.**

The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
- After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
- After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

## 9 The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.

### THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS
"In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed". As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.
We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them.
Often, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without remembering.
Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1. The close
2. The many.
3. The powerful.

#### 1. Imitating the Close
We pick up habits from the people around us: Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.

#### 2. Imitating the Many

##### CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS
Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior (amazon reviews). The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth.
When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.

#### 3. Imitating the Powerful
Once we fit in the tribe, we start looking for ways to stand out. This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. We imitate people we envy. We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status.

## 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

### WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM
Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive: Conserve energy. Obtain food and water. Find love and reproduce. Connect and bond with others. Win social acceptance and approval. Reduce uncertainty. Achieve status and prestige.

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.
Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.

Our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.
These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving. A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.
Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. **When emotions and feelings are impaired**, we actually lose the ability to make decisions.

Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.

### HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift: instead of "have" to, use "get" to, change from burdens and turn them into opportunities.
Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.
- Exercise: instead of "need to go run" use "time to build endurance and get fast".
- Meditation: you need distraction to focus again.
- Pregame jitters: You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”

They can help change the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.
If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation: putting my headphones (don't need to play music).

The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them.

**The 3rd Law: Make It Easy**

## 11 Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”

When you’re in **motion**, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. **Action**, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. Motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.

When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.

### HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?
Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.”. Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned. Repetition is a form of change

Habits form based on frequency, not time. To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen is to **make it easy**.

## 12 The Law of Least Effort
Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. The less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur. You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.
If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.
The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.

### HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT
Make your habits simple and easy. One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design.
When we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy (addition by subtraction), we can achieve more with less effort. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.
Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.

### PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE
Order after every use. Set the desktop to zero. Put the tv in a closet after watch it. Leave your phone in a different room until lunch.
Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.

## 13 How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow, can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway.
Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as **decisive moments**, they set the options available to your future self.

### THE TWO-MINUTE RULE
When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:
- “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
- “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
- “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
- “Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
- “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”

What you want is a **gateway habit** that naturally leads you down a more productive path.
Habit must be established before it can be improved. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night.

If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then stop. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,”. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.
At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process.

Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior.

## 14 How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
A **commitment device** is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.
The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.

### HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN
The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act.

#### ONETIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS
- Nutrition: Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water. Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.
- Sleep
- Productivity: Turn off notifications and mute group chats. Delete games and social media apps on your phone.
- Happiness: Move to a friendly, social neighborhood.
- General Health: Buy good shoes to avoid back pain. Buy a supportive chair or standing desk
- Finance: Enroll in an automatic savings plan.

When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.
The average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?

**The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying**

## 15 The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.

### THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS
many of the choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors. It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.

the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time (hyperbolic discounting). Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years.
With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse.

As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification, the last mile is always the least crowded.

Success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.

### HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.

Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance (no alcohol this month). One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.

Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. **You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you**. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

## 16 How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.

### HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK
Don’t break the chain
habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.

What can we do to make tracking easier?
First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.

The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: 
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].

### HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN
**never miss twice.** Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.
It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it: it reaffirms your identity. “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”

### KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT
The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.
This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done.
We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.
Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.
