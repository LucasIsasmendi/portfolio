# The Startup Equation
> A Visual Guidebook for Building Your Startup

Assemble your “A-team”: A talented group who are individually challenged to remain as flexible as possible to solve a problem.

No matter where you are on planet Earth, building, launching, and scaling a company leverages many of the same elements in order to be successful.

So, here is some wise advice given to me that I’ll pass along to you:
1. Be humble. Failure is a known and very common outcome. Failure itself is not failure, but an unhumble project is just that.
2. Be bold. Don’t be afraid to lead or to set up an experiment and test some assumptions out. Take your views and style and put them into action.

Think about what you want to create. Ask yourself, “What problem am I looking to solve?” So I ask you, as someone asked me: why don’t you just fix that? What is stopping you?
Build something great and take the time to enjoy the process.
