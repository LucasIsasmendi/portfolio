## Introduction

### Lean Is a Mindset
Lean is a mindset—a mental model of how the world works. In this book we present a mental model of how to design and deliver amazing products that delight customers. We start with two foundational questions: What is the purpose of a business? What kind of work systems are best for accomplishing that purpose? Next we explore ways to create an environment that energizes the people whose intelligence and creativity are essential to creating great products. Then we turn our attention to the process of creating products and services that work well and delight customers. We move on to consider efficiency—because this is a book about lean, after all, and lean has always been associated with efficiency. We demonstrate that genuine efficiency in product development is about developing the right product, creating a steady flow of new knowledge, and linking the design and delivery processes together to gain rapid customer feedback. Finally, we move beyond efficiency to innovation and discuss how great products come from changing the focus . . . from productivity to impact . . . from predictability to experimentation . . . from efficiency to decentralization . . . and from product to problem.

### How Mindsets Work
Our minds are amazing. It appears to us that we make decisions thoughtfully and deliberately, but research has shown that most of the time we make decisions instinctively, based on the mindset we have developed over time. It’s almost as if we have two minds—one that builds our mindset and corrects it from time to time, and another that reacts quickly to situations as they develop, drawing on the currently available mindset to arbitrate trade-offs.

The Dual Processing Theory works something like this: Humans have two different methods for processing information, and each method operates more or less independently of the other one, exchanging information at appropriate times. Sometimes the two processes arrive at different conclusions, and that’s when we become aware of the fact that we have two minds, because they are in conflict with each other.

#### System 1 and System 2
System 1: autopilot mode. System 2: manual mode (we develop or modify our mindsets).
System 2 is slow. It takes much longer than System 1 to make decisions and get things done. In addition, System 2 is lazy; its preferred approach is to turn as much work as possible over to System 1. So modifying a mindset takes deliberate effort and considerable time—time spent reading a book, for example.

### The Fabric of Lean
- ch1 Reciprocity was the basis of human cooperation long before money was invented, and it remains central to human behavior today. However, reciprocity is local. It depends on group (or team) size, team member engagement, and norms for creating and enforcing mutual obligations.

- ch2 Regulatory fit is a theory that says some people are biased toward action and experimentation and respond well to aspirational challenges. Other people prefer to be safe rather than sorry. For them, challenges that focus on duty and failure prevention are more inspiring.

- ch3 Before diving into development, it is important to Learn First to understand the essential system issues and customer problems before attempting to solve them. Great products are designed by teams that are able to empathize with customers, ask the right questions, identify critical problems, examine multiple possibilities, and then develop products and services that delight customers.

- ch4 in product development, efficiency is first and foremost about building the right thing. Focus on Customers, Deliver Fast, Energize Workers, and Build Quality In at work.
