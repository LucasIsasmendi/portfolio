## Ch02 Decentralization
The basic idea of decentralization is to distribute control and authority to peripheries

### Decentralization using blockchain
A platform that does not need any intermediaries and can function with many different leaders chosen via consensus mechanisms, like Proof of Work (PoW).
Is applied in varying degrees from semi-decentralized to fully decentralized to give full control to users.
Operates with no single point of failure or single trusted authority.

The concepts of central(client--server), distributed(central authority), and decentralized was first published in 1964 in a paper by Paul Baran on distributed communication networks in the context of communication networks.

### Methods of decentralization

#### Disintermediation
bitcoin, no bank intermediary, decentralization is achieved by disintermediation (still fees).

#### Through competition
In this method, a group of service providers compete with each other in order to be selected for the provision of services by the system.

##### Scale of decentralization
While there are many benefits of decentralization--including but not limited to transparency, efficiency, cost saving, development of trusted ecosystems, and in some cases privacy and anonymity--some challenges, such as security requirements, software bugs, and human errors, also need to be looked at thoroughly.

### Routes to decentralization

#### How to decentralize
A framework has been proposed by Arvind Narayanan:
1.  What is being decentralized?
2.  What level of decentralization is required?
3.  What blockchain is used?
4.  What security mechanism is used?

Example: money transfer system
1. Money transfer system.
2. Disintermediation.
3. bitcoin
4. Atomicity

### Blockchain and full ecosystem decentralization
Blockchain itself is a distributed ledger that runs on top of conventional systems. These elements include storage, communication, and computation.

- Storage
Blockchain is not suitable for storing large amounts of data by design. A better alternative is to use Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). The incentive mechanism is based on a protocol known as Filecoin. There are other alternatives, such as Ethereum swarm, storj, and maidsafe, BigChainDB.


- Communication
An alternative to internet is to use mesh networks. Even though they are limited in functionality as compared to the Internet, they still provide a decentralized alternative where nodes can talk directly to each other without a central hub such as an ISP.
An example of a Meshnet is Firechat (http://www.opengarden.com/firechat.html), which allows iPhone users to communicate with each other directly in a peer-to-peer fashion without the Internet.

- Computation
Processing layer platforms where business logic can run over the network in a decentralized manner (Ethereum).
A concept relevant to Identity known as Zooko's Triangle requires that a naming system in a network protocol be secure, decentralized, and meaningful to humans. It is conjectured that a system can have only two of these properties simultaneously, but with the advent of blockchain, in the form of Namecoin, this problem was resolved.

### Smart contract
These small programs reside on the blockchain and execute business logic if some specific criteria are met.

### Decentralized organizations (DOs)
 Are software programs that run on a blockchain and are based on the idea of real human organizations with people and protocols.

### Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)
DAO and DO are basically the same thing, but the main difference is that DAOs are autonomous, which means that they are fully automated and contain artificially intelligent logic, whereas DOs lack this feature and rely on human input in order to execute business logic.
Ethereum blockchain led the way with the introduction of DAOs for the first time.

### Decentralized autonomous corporations (DAC)
DAOs, Decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs) are a similar concept but are considered a smaller subset of DAOs. DAOs are usually considered to be nonprofit, whereas DACs can make money via shares offered to the participants and by paying dividends.

### Decentralized autonomous societies (DAS)
This might be seen as a libertarian or cypherpunk dream but is entirely possible on a blockchain.

### Decentralized applications (DAPPS)
All ideas mentioned earlier come under the larger umbrella of decentralized applications. All DAOs, DACs, and DOs are basically decentralized applications that run on top of a blockchain in a peer-to-peer network. This is the latest advancement in technology with regard to decentralization. Decentralized applications or DAPPs are software programs that can run on their own blockchain, use another already existing established blockchain, or use only protocols of an existing blockchain solution. These are called Type I, Type II, and Type III DAPPs.

#### Requirements of a decentralized application
In order for an application to be considered a decentralized application, it must meet the following criteria. This definition was provided by David Johnston and others in their whitepaper called [The General Theory of Decentralized Applications](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications), Dapps:

1.  The DAPP should be fully open source and autonomous and no single entity should be in control of a majority of its tokens. All changes to the application must be consensus-driven based on the feedback given by the community.
2.  Data and records of operations of the application must be cryptographically secured and stored on a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.
3.  A cryptographic token must be used by the application in order to provide access and rewards to those who contribute value to the applications, for example, miners in bitcoin.
4.  The tokens must be generated by the decentralized application according to a standard cryptographic algorithm. This generation of tokens acts as a proof of the value to contributors (for example, miners).

#### Operations of a DAPP
Establishment of consensus, token distribution, fundraising, and development.

#### Examples
- KYC-Chain: Know Your Customer.
- OpenBazaar: commercial activities directly between sellers and buyers.
- Lazooz: decentralized equivalent of Uber
