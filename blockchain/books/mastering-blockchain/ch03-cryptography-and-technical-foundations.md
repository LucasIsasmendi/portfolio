## Ch03 Cryptography and Technical Foundations

Cryptography provides various security services, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, (Entity Authentication and Data origin authentication) and non-repudiation.

### Mathematics
- set: collection of distinct objects
- group: closed and associated with an identity element defined.
- field: set that contains both additive and multiplicative groups (distributive).
- finite field: finite set of elements (Galois), used to produce accurate and error-free results of arithmetic operations: prime finite fields are used in elliptic curve cryptography to construct discrete logarithm problem.
- order: number of elements, cardinality
- prime fields: finite field with a prime number of elements: e and -e.
- ring: abelian group with more than one operation and closure, associative and distributive properties
- cyclic group: generated by a single element.
- abelian group:
- modular arithmetic:
- cryptography:
