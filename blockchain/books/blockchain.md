### What is Blockchain?

Group of transactions, part of a common ledger, entered and verified by multiple sources.
Each piece of data added is tested. No single person inputs into the database and verifies their own information. The data contributor is identified by the IP address, as well as the verifier. Information is anonymous and encoded, transaction information is incomplete and permanent.
Each block of data is linked to the previous block of data by a timestamp: date, time, origin.
Foundation identifier number. A person access to the blockchain with the identified number.
Blockchain steps to verified information:
1.  Consensus: majority agree
2.  Consistency: new fits with previous
3.  Transaction: avoid conflicts
4.  Automated Conflict Identifiers: by software
5.  No centralized location

### Why is Blockchain Important?

There is no paper. The Bitcoun value is determined by supply and demand, as there are a certain number of Bitcoins issued.
Blockchain is underpinned by the proof-of-work system, which verifies the transaction by requesting a unique identifier to the processor puzzle to be solved before the transaction is accepted. 
Altcoins are limited in their scope of production and distribution: Bitcoin has set their coinage formation at 21 million altcoins in circulation.
Bitcoin are trustworthier with transactions and therefore require 10 minutes for the information to be processed.

### Long-term Projections about Blockchain

IBM has created such framework that will enale them to begin using Blockchain within their own institution in the near future.
Private vs Public blockchain. It won't really take off until it becomes more accessible to the general public.
