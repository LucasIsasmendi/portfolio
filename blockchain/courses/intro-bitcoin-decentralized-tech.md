## Big Ideas & Basic Use Demos
* Privacy (not requires login) & Pseudo-anonymity(uses IP address). 
* Customer Push the money instead of Merchant pull it from the Bank.
How works? Unique Bitcoin address generated for my connection.
* [Transactions](https://blockchain.info/) Every transaction is public, but the identity are privates as long as you can connect bc address with a real identity.
* Low fees(0.03 vs 0.30 from banks)
* Bitcoin transactions irreversible
* Distributed control (Bookkeeper): 
    -  Transaction = From:x To:x Amount:x, 
    -  Ledger = account x, balance y.
so bitcoin is a group of people maintaining a ledger.
* Rooted in Faith: scarce, easyand fast transfer, secure

### Security
Prevent any unauthorized changes to balances: Signature = Cryptographic Digital Signature (gives Authenticity, base on Public Key Encription).
- Bitcoin Address = Public Key.
- Signature Creation Function = Private Key.

### Bookkeepers
Bitcoin consensus

### Smart Contract

### Wallet
* if you lose your private key, you lose your money
