> I think the key to building a startup is not about your original idea because you’ve talked to so many entrepreneurs before, I think almost all of them will tell you there are all these twists and turns before they find the right idea.

> The key to entrepreneurship is about solving problems, not being afraid and also have the patience to solve problems and then learn from the lessons and adjust your strategy. When you do that often enough, then the right idea will come.  

> My dad told me–this is a key thing that inspires me to today–he said, “Success is not about how smart you are. It’s not about how high your IQ or EQ is. It’s about who survived until the very end,” because a business will always go in cycles. When there’s a downturn or when there is a difficult time and when your competitors drop out and you’re the only one that’s left in the race, by definition, you’re going to win the race. ”  

> The lesson is how to get the answer to a complicated question so it’s not that you remember all these answers, it’s that you learned how to find the answer when you understand the question.

> So, I think that’s one of the things that I’ve learned through the entire process, whether it’s my educational background at Stanford or what I’ve learned through almost going bankrupt and what my dad taught me is to not be afraid of a challenge and see a challenge as opportunity to survive and thrive. I think I would probably want to end on that. It’s about an attitude. It’s not about–it’s about a means to an end, not the end.
