Tutorials and bootcamps are all about book knowledge. For maximum coding productivity, you need deep knowledge of exactly what needs to be built and why!
The specific tool choices are not important. What is important is that the end result supports an individual or organizational goal.

Doing the research:
* Dig for the larger context
* Build and use mental models
* Confront risk head-on (concierge MVP)
