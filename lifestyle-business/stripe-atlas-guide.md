## Writing copy for landing pages
> Write copy that delights visitors, persuades prospects, and wins customers

Some companies use their homepage as a landing page. Others create specific pages that target discrete customer profiles and move them through a marketing funnel.

> Common missteps: landing pages prioritize the story of the startup, rather than the journey of the customer with the startup.

Landing page copy improves the more customers see themselves in it. 

### Quick wins for better landing page copy
- **Focus copy on them**: replace “we offer” or “our solution,” with the word `you`. Another tip is to start your sentence with a verb. 
- **Add pattern, texture, and shine to a block of copy**
  - Apply a pattern to a sentence. Patterns may be used to subtly reference a logo or map out a theme.
  - Vary sentence length and formatting to create texture, write a smooth, polished sentence and juxtapose it with a more staccato sentence.
  - Include a glossy word or two for shine. The bright adjective and stronger verbs adds punch to the copy.
- **Defang objections with an “even if” clause**: “[Claim] even if [objection].”
- **Limit each sentence to one idea**: The more you help readers with information digestion, the more appetite they’ll have to read on. So edit every sentence to have just one thought.
- **Create a landing page that’s not your homepage**: A landing page is designed to convert prospects into customers with call-to-action and precise offering. A homepage serves a broad audience. Consider linking to the page on your site that best addresses a visitor’s intent.

### The foundational elements of effective landing page copy
landing page copy is never done. Like your company, it will—and should—evolve over time.
Copy for a high-performing landing page has three foundational qualities:
- **It delivers a convincing first impression for the startup**
- **It considers the maturity of the market.**
- **It reflects the customer’s stage of awareness.**:
  - Most aware: Purchases happen here.
  - Product-aware: Free trials, demos, and purchases happen here.
  - Solution-aware
  - Problem-aware
  - Unaware

Landing page copy reflects the customer if you can answer “yes” to the following questions:
- Is the language accessible and does it mirror a visitor’s stage of awareness?
- Does the copy move them from where they are to where they want to be
- Are visitors prompted to take action once they become Product-aware or Most aware?

### The elements of landing page copy in action
Every landing page should deliver a convincing first impression, consider the maturity of the market, and reflect the customer’s stage of awareness. Examples
- Kapwing: don't sacrifice a clear message for a short one. Listen to your customers, write what they say.
- WebGazer: focus on you

### Take the first step with your landing page copy
Landing page copy is an underleveraged, powerful tool. Done right, it builds brand, engenders trust, and sells product. But it’s not automatic. Landing page copy must deliver a convincing first impression, consider the maturity of the market, and reflect the customer’s stage of awareness. It must meet prospects where they are and get them to where they—and the business—want them to be.
