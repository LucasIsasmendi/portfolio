## 1. An Introduction to Zero to Sold
This book will show you what the life of a bootstrapped founder will look like,  roles required and task in each stage. In the end, you are the agent of your own success. Read and learn as much as you can, but treat all guidance and direction as anecdotal. You will have to find your own combination of strategies and tactics.

## 2. The FeedbackPanda Story
A service born out of necessity, a product that solved one critical problem for a well-defined audience

## 3. The Four Stages of a Bootstrapped Business in a Nutshell
separated by revenue and profit levels:
- Preparation: finding an audience, their biggest problem, and a solution that solves that problem in a way to make people pay for it.
- Survival: finding a repeatable way to make money
- Stability: stable, mature product
- Growth: keep running the company or sell it?

## 4. The Preparation Stage
Every business starts as an imaginary construct. First, you will need to turn your idea into a product you can sell. Then, you will need to create a business: a system that allows you to sell that product over and over again.

In this stage, the you will work on the prototype of your product, the audience and problem analysis, solution ideas and validation, and audience verification and customer outreach.

### From Idea to Product
Avoid solutions looking for a problem. Make these foundational choice: solve critical problems for an audience that will pay for it. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change (pivoting is extra effort). 

#### How to Start a Bootstrapped Business
`AUDIENCE -{Who needs help?}-> PROBLEM -{what do they need help with?}-> PRODUCT -{this solves a problem for my audience}-> SUCCESS`  

many founders fail because they build their businesses with a product-first approach. But audience research, problem analysis, and solution validation should happen before you think about a product.
Build a great business on a validated market, filling a validated need for people who will be able to pay enough. Start with an audience, a specific niche. Create a product  centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers.

`1.Audience (Who?) -> 2.Critical Problem (Why?) -> 3.Solution (How?) -> 4.Product (What?)`  
**1 - Audience**
- **Find the perfect niche**: homogenous;  share attributes, pains and problems; want custom-made solution. Inside a niche, you can find a problem and build a specific solution that makes a difference. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/power-of-the-niche/)
- **Find a market to build a SaaS**: niche that is large enough(potential paying customers), small enough (not to much competition, defined customer base), audience is capable of paying and willing to do it. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-a-market-to-build-a-saas/)
- **Determining the Size of a Market**: research, experts, publications, etc. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/determining-the-size-of-your-saas-market/)

**2 - Problem**: You already have the right people. Now you just need the right problem, the most critical and painful that needs a solution.
- **Finding the Critical Problem: How to Work on The Right Thing**: painful, can’t be avoided, takes time or money to solve every time, occurs frequently and repeatedly, `Problems > Problems they will pay for > critical problems` [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-the-critical-problem/)
- **Finding the Most Painful Problem in a Market**: awareness levels: no problem, it can’t be solved, don't get the solution. Any problem where people are using makeshift solutions (postit, excel, word docs) will be a viable candidate. Talk to people who are experts in your market. Find the people who care: ask where they want to be in their work and what is keeping them from accomplishing that. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-the-most-painful-problem/)
- **Problem Validation: Making Sure You’re Talking To The Right People**: ignore people who loves complaining, but they don’t want things to change. Customer Fit Questions: Are they enthusiastic about where things are going? Do they want to participate in the change that makes their industry better? Dig deep into their reasoning, and skip leading questions. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/problem-validation/)

**3 - Solution**: A solution is not a product, is a more general answer to the question “how could this be done better”  where a product answers the question, “what do I use to deal with it.” You need to validate the solutions you find to get to the one that has maximum impact.
- **Solution Validation Doesn’t Happen In a Vacuum: How to Talk To Your Future Customers**: Talk about how your proposed change will impact their existing workflow. Avoid unintended side-effects. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/solution-validation-doesnt-happen-in-a-vacuum-how-to-talk-to-your-future-customers/)
- **Asking the Right Questions: Focus on Problems Instead of Solutions**: ask where they are now, where they want to be, and what stands in the way of getting there. The winning solution, and finally your product, is a result of this conversation, not a part of it. It’s about finding the most impactful, most value-producing solution with the least amount of friction and the highest possible chance of adoption.

**4 - Product**: turning the idea into a real thing.
- **The Myth of The Finished Product**: In software, no product is ever finished. But at some point, it is good enough. A purchase is an ultimate validation. I believe that you need to have two things in a product for it to be an `MVP`: 1) enough working functionality to solve the problem for your early adopter customers (`minimum`) and 2) the means to charge them money for it (`viable`). Do things manually until it makes sense to devote the efforts to build a solution. Release early to be able to receive immediate feedback. Release safely, take this seriously and keep backups. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/the-myth-of-the-finished-product/)
- **The Boring Truth of Successful Products That Survive**: they do one thing very well. And not much else. Simple beats complicated. Once you have solved your problem, keep it simple. Take the thing that is hard to solve, and do that every time. After a while, you will be so far ahead of anyone else.
- **Not in House: On Reinventing the Wheel**: Don’t build an authentication system yourself, use Auth0. Don’t build a payment system yourself, use stripe. Don’t build an invoicing system yourself, use specialized company.

### From Product to Business
A product is not a business.

#### Forget Goals, Create Systems: Foundations of a Sustainable Bootstrapped Business
Build a system that works, the core of the business.

A sustainable bootstrapped business is successful when you have found a repeatable, reliable, and resilient system to continuously provide a value-producing product to paying customers at a profit.
Such a system will need to be continuously refined and improved. This is the heart of your operation. It must never stop working. You will never be done making sure it’s working correctly.
Set a price, make people aware of it, convince them to purchase, transform them into long term customers
- **Your Initial Pricing Will Never Be Right, But Try Anyway**: At the beginning of your business, revenue serves one purpose before any other: validation of the product, value, and problem. Underpricing your product will create a few problems down the road, like price-sensitive-customers. Price always communicates value. Overpricing your product, on the other hand, is not as bad. Offer yearly subscriptions. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/your-initial-pricing-will-never-be-right/)
- **Do You Need a Co-Founder?**: depends on the circumstances of your business and yourself. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/co-founder/)
