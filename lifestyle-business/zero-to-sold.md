## 1. An Introduction to Zero to Sold
This book will show you what the life of a bootstrapped founder will look like,  roles required and task in each stage. In the end, you are the agent of your own success. Read and learn as much as you can, but treat all guidance and direction as anecdotal. You will have to find your own combination of strategies and tactics.

## 2. The FeedbackPanda Story
A service born out of necessity, a product that solved one critical problem for a well-defined audience

## 3. The Four Stages of a Bootstrapped Business in a Nutshell
separated by revenue and profit levels:
- Preparation: finding an audience, their biggest problem, and a solution that solves that problem in a way to make people pay for it.
- Survival: finding a repeatable way to make money
- Stability: stable, mature product
- Growth: keep running the company or sell it?

## 4. The Preparation Stage
Every business starts as an imaginary construct. First, you will need to turn your idea into a product you can sell. Then, you will need to create a business: a system that allows you to sell that product over and over again.

In this stage, the you will work on the prototype of your product, the audience and problem analysis, solution ideas and validation, and audience verification and customer outreach.

### From Idea to Product
Avoid solutions looking for a problem. Make these foundational choice: solve critical problems for an audience that will pay for it. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change (pivoting is extra effort). 

#### How to Start a Bootstrapped Business
`AUDIENCE -{Who needs help?}-> PROBLEM -{what do they need help with?}-> PRODUCT -{this solves a problem for my audience}-> SUCCESS`  

many founders fail because they build their businesses with a product-first approach. But audience research, problem analysis, and solution validation should happen before you think about a product.
Build a great business on a validated market, filling a validated need for people who will be able to pay enough. Start with an audience, a specific niche. Create a product  centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers.

`1.Audience (Who?) -> 2.Critical Problem (Why?) -> 3.Solution (How?) -> 4.Product (What?)`  
**1 - Audience**
- **Find the perfect niche**: homogenous;  share attributes, pains and problems; want custom-made solution. Inside a niche, you can find a problem and build a specific solution that makes a difference. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/power-of-the-niche/)
- **Find a market to build a SaaS**: niche that is large enough(potential paying customers), small enough (not to much competition, defined customer base), audience is capable of paying and willing to do it. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-a-market-to-build-a-saas/)
- **Determining the Size of a Market**: research, experts, publications, etc. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/determining-the-size-of-your-saas-market/)

**2 - Problem**: You already have the right people. Now you just need the right problem, the most critical and painful that needs a solution.
- **Finding the Critical Problem: How to Work on The Right Thing**: painful, can’t be avoided, takes time or money to solve every time, occurs frequently and repeatedly, `Problems > Problems they will pay for > critical problems` [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-the-critical-problem/)
- **Finding the Most Painful Problem in a Market**: awareness levels: no problem, it can’t be solved, don't get the solution. Any problem where people are using makeshift solutions (postit, excel, word docs) will be a viable candidate. Talk to people who are experts in your market. Find the people who care: ask where they want to be in their work and what is keeping them from accomplishing that. [Detail](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-the-most-painful-problem/)
- **Problem Validation: Making Sure You’re Talking To The Right People**: ignore people who loves complaining, but they don’t want things to change. Customer Fit Questions: Are they enthusiastic about where things are going? Do they want to participate in the change that makes their industry better? Dig deep into their reasoning, and skip leading questions. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/problem-validation/)

**3 - Solution**: A solution is not a product, is a more general answer to the question “how could this be done better”  where a product answers the question, “what do I use to deal with it.” You need to validate the solutions you find to get to the one that has maximum impact.
- **Solution Validation Doesn’t Happen In a Vacuum: How to Talk To Your Future Customers**: Talk about how your proposed change will impact their existing workflow. Avoid unintended side-effects. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/solution-validation-doesnt-happen-in-a-vacuum-how-to-talk-to-your-future-customers/)
- **Asking the Right Questions: Focus on Problems Instead of Solutions**: ask where they are now, where they want to be, and what stands in the way of getting there. The winning solution, and finally your product, is a result of this conversation, not a part of it. It’s about finding the most impactful, most value-producing solution with the least amount of friction and the highest possible chance of adoption.

**4 - Product**: turning the idea into a real thing.
- **The Myth of The Finished Product**: In software, no product is ever finished. But at some point, it is good enough. A purchase is an ultimate validation. I believe that you need to have two things in a product for it to be an `MVP`: 1) enough working functionality to solve the problem for your early adopter customers (`minimum`) and 2) the means to charge them money for it (`viable`). Do things manually until it makes sense to devote the efforts to build a solution. Release early to be able to receive immediate feedback. Release safely, take this seriously and keep backups. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/the-myth-of-the-finished-product/)
- **The Boring Truth of Successful Products That Survive**: they do one thing very well. And not much else. Simple beats complicated. Once you have solved your problem, keep it simple. Take the thing that is hard to solve, and do that every time. After a while, you will be so far ahead of anyone else.
- **Not in House: On Reinventing the Wheel**: Don’t build an authentication system yourself, use Auth0. Don’t build a payment system yourself, use stripe. Don’t build an invoicing system yourself, use specialized company.

### From Product to Business
A product is not a business.

#### Forget Goals, Create Systems: Foundations of a Sustainable Bootstrapped Business
Build a system that works, the core of the business.

A sustainable bootstrapped business is successful when you have found a repeatable, reliable, and resilient system to continuously provide a value-producing product to paying customers at a profit.
Such a system will need to be continuously refined and improved. This is the heart of your operation. It must never stop working. You will never be done making sure it’s working correctly.
Set a price, make people aware of it, convince them to purchase, transform them into long term customers
- **Your Initial Pricing Will Never Be Right, But Try Anyway**: At the beginning of your business, revenue serves one purpose before any other: validation of the product, value, and problem. Underpricing your product will create a few problems down the road, like price-sensitive-customers. Price always communicates value. Overpricing your product, on the other hand, is not as bad. Offer yearly subscriptions. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/your-initial-pricing-will-never-be-right/)
- **Do You Need a Co-Founder?**: depends on the circumstances of your business and yourself. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/co-founder/)

## 5. The Survival Stage
In this stage, you will work on rapid product iterations, on building resilient systems to deal with the complexity of operating a business. You will look for reliable and repeatable processes to guarantee a profitable engine of sustainable growth and will work on helping customers first to find the product and then find their way through it.

### Mental Health: It’s Not Optional
Running a bootstrapped company is particularly hard.
Learning about how to deal with perfectionism, impostor syndrome, and similar psychological hurdles will make you resilient to self-sabotage. Focus on what matters most: building a life-changing bootstrapped business.

- **Real and Imaginary Responsibilities of a Bootstrapped Founder**: Avoid perfectionism. Avoid feeling like a fraud (impostor syndrome). Be aware of "this is how it is done" cult, built the company you need. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/real-and-imaginary-responsibilities-of-a-bootstrapped-founder/)
- **The Bootstrapper’s Plight: The Social Headaches of Building a Business**: Understand that your time has value, and your vision deserves respect. Don’t let people distract you from your goals. Find supportive people. Find your fellow founders. They’ll get you. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/the-bootstrappers-plight/)

### Product Evolution: Controlled Growth and Saying No
Saying “no” to feature requests becomes a necessary skill to learn. Only add features that provide value to all of the customers and can be easily moved out. What is required today may be obsolete or harmful tomorrow.

**Building the Right Things**: which items are more critical and which requests may sound vital but are not.
- **First Things First: Feature Prioritization Frameworks**: RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence against Effort), DIE (Demand and Impact against Effort), Kano, Opportunity Scoring, Story Mapping. Make sure to stick to one system once you have found it to be usable for your business. 
- **Build for Value, Not for Applause: Product Management Under Heavy Constraints**: for every feature or improvement make sure it impacts as many customers as possible at the same time. Don’t go overboard with the optics. 

**Building Things Right**: Building your product with abstractions and flexibility in mind will allow you to change it easier and more securely later.
- **Abstractions**: never integrate third-party-service directly. Abstract integeations, create modules to handle them: payment, authentication, notifications, chat, email, database connections, logging, and metrics collection.
- **Flexible Architecture**: start small and cheap, scaling only when you need to. Begin by encapsulating your backend systems in Docker containers. This flexibility extends to selling the business as well. 
- **Making Tech Choices: Don’t Add Risk to an Already Risky Business**: Choose the technology that works best for you and your business. Many technical founders see a new startup as an opportunity to figure out a modern tech stack. That is a precarious move. When in doubt, stick to what you know. For data storage systems like databases, use tried and tested systems like PostgreSQL.

### Customers: Building Relationships That Last
it’s easier to keep a customer than it is to find a new one. In the SaaS world, maintaining a relationship with customers is critical, keep them happy. Move away from customers that are not right for your business.

- **How to Do Maximum Customer Service with Minimum Effort**: chat widgets (sync tools) for real problems. Automatic responses and resolution chatbots (async tools, last resort) to help customers. Knowledge bases for self-help (favorite). Example tool: intercom. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/how-to-do-maximum-customer-support-with-minimum-effort/)
- **You May Be Barking Up the Wrong Tree: Re-Evaluating Your Audience**: you don’t have to bend your product into a shape that works for a market that doesn’t value your vision. Of course, if all of your customers exhibit this behavior, you should stop and reflect if you are talking to the wrong audience altogether. Find the customers that don’t complain and see what makes them happy. Find more of them.
- **Churn, Retention, and Revenue: What Makes Customers Stick Around and Why That’s Important**: The first and obvious goal is to continuously provide them with a valuable product throughout their customer journey. Reaching out manually will be extremely fruitful to find and resolve the issues that motivate customers to leave. Value Nurturing: showing the customer the value they’re receiving from your product while they are using it (statistics, time saving). [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/churn-retention-and-revenue/)

### Pricing: Subscriptions, Plans, And Other Money Troubles
Strategies that will help you find the plans and prices that work best.
- **Price Is Not Set In Stone: Strategies For Increasing Your Revenue**: Inform every customer who will be affected by this change, don't be sneaky. use the price from trial. Enterprise customers are dangerous beasts.
- **Not All Subscribers Are Equal: How to Deal with Plans That No Longer Work**: avoid life-long discount and Grandfathering. Allow them to keep the lower price for a year if they upgrade to a yearly subscription. Force them to upgrade to the new price
- **Not All Subscriptions Are Equal: Offer Yearly Plans from the Start**: they trust your business to be around in a year, product, and stick with you. Discount your yearly subscriptions, a discounted plan can come with a non-refundable clause.
- **Seller Beware: Pricing Models That Can Break Your Business**: Two pricing models can be hazardous if not implemented carefully: freemium (set clear limits) and lifetime accounts (resource consumption).

### Business
- **Make It Sell Itself: On Referral Systems**: be careful to provide a clear value proposition to the referrer and the referred. [More here](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/on-referral-systems/)

### Marketing and Sales
Spreading the word is an essential part of running a business, and so is convincing potential customers to try the product and eventually purchase it.
- **Spreading the Word: How to Do Marketing on a Shoestring Budget**: poeple in a niche are organized in communities where word of mouth spreads quickly. Genuinely participate in niche communities. Don’t just use them as a marketing platform. Contribute, don't advertise, create meaningful content around your product. In a way, you want to become part of and eventually lead a tribe.  Listen to what people ask and complain about and offer your product embedded in more general advice. Create easy-to-consume and easy-to-share content
- **How to Sell as a Bootstrapper: Strategies That Work**: You don’t have time or the resources to sell them what they want. You will need to sell them what they will buy. If you value your independence, go after a large number of smaller customers instead of just a few big ones. Improve your sales process with real people.
- **Being Small Is a Benefit: How to Leverage Being a Bootstrapper**: People treat you differently when you show that you’re in the market because you care. In the end, it boils down to honesty. 
- **Too Many Eyes: Why Bootstrapped Companies Stop Being Transparent (Eventually)**: Essentially, being outspoken and transparent about your business is a form of marketing. You’re building a brand around your honesty, your ambition, and your commitment. However, there comes the point when being too transparent can cause damage to your business.

## 8. Bonus: The Many Roles of a Bootstrapped Founder
imagine how your company looks five years from now and draw an imaginary org chart with all the positions that you will need to hire for. Then, put your name into each box. Now you know precisely what you will need to do throughout the lifetime of your business.

**The Four Bootstrapper Quadrants**
1. **The Builder** technical skill and operational work. Implementation. *How* to solve a problem.
2. **The Architect** technical expertise and structural thinking. Analysis. *What* needs to be done. Includes billing and financials.
3. **The Thinker** creative thinking and structural analysis. planning and forecasting. *Why* things are the way they are and what can be done about it. Design: UX, Ad. You will work on extracting insights and learnings from past data, and then turning that into strategies and visions for the future of the business. 
4. **The Communicator** creative solutions and operational interactions. communication and distribution. *Who* we are serving, helping, and talking to. If talking to people is not for you, then find someone who loves to do that. 

Depending on what stage of your bootstrapped business you’re in, you will focus more on some jobs and less on others.
As a guideline, try to do work that will generate revenue or revenue opportunities. Those will move your business forward. Introduce new activities and responsibilities as they become necessary, not before.

> bootstrapping is the act of creating a valuable, sustainable business with little to no funding. It’s a founder mindset, a focus on making fiscally responsible business decisions and looking for sustainable long-term growth, and meaningful relationships with every single customer.
