## 1. What is Micro-SaaS and Why Should You Read This?
[on May 11, 2016](https://tylertringas.com/1-what-is-micro-saas/)  
The main difference between SaaS and other software is the business model: customers pay monthly or annually for continued access. “micro” just means small.
I think a Micro-SaaS business is possibly the most powerful lifestyle business model out there right now. 

### Why Would You Want a Micro-SaaS Business?
- Owning a Craft: see the fruits of your labors directly delivered. 
- Location Independence
- Time Leverage: The Magic of Recurring Revenue. SaaS can be a business that not only yields money, but starts to give you back your time.
- Building a Financial Launchpad: a Micro-SaaS business could fund you while you spend six month writing a novel or trying to make it big in the acting or music business or starting a big risky ambitious project.

## Chapter 4: From Idea to Minimum Viable Product
on November 29, 2016

Once you get an idea that looks worth doing, you should carve out time to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as soon as possible. 

> work will expand or contract to fill the time allotted to it. If you give yourself an unlimited time horizon to launch a product you’ll likely never finish it

### Shipping a Minimum Viable Product
- **Build first or Pre-launch?**: Pre-launch(build email list) delays getting paying customers. Recommendation: massively pare down the scope of the MVP and just launch it fast.
- **What I mean by “MVP”**: do the job it purports to do.

### Building an MVP: Don’ts
most important thing, it will help keep the scope pared back.
- **Only build for new users**: skip account info, reset password, change login details, etc.
- **Go very light on branding**: do not hire someone to make you a logo, build fancy landing page, spend hours in CSS
- **Other common features that you can skip**: plans and pricing options. FRee tier(freemium). Multipayment. Multi users per account.
- **Leave out everything that you can do manually** 
- **Avoid the faux professionalism**: custom email address, fancy help desk apps, your phone number

### Building an MVP: Do’s
- **Use (and pay for) existing services**: Re-inventing the wheel is the enemy of the MVP
- **Separate your app and your landing page**
- **Do ask for credit cards upfront**: avoid free plan. At this stage you are still maximizing for information and feedback. The cost structure of freemium is risky
- **Use a single price point**: start between $9-15/month and raised it as the features were ironed out.
- **Admin Login: The one bit of code your app must have**: 

### Conclusion
Shipping a first version of the product is the biggest hurdle in the entire journey to a profitable software business.
Use this chapter to pare back an idea to it’s essence, schedule the time and ship it.
