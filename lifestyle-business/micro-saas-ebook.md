## 1. What is Micro-SaaS and Why Should You Read This?
[on May 11, 2016](https://tylertringas.com/1-what-is-micro-saas/)  
The main difference between SaaS and other software is the business model: customers pay monthly or annually for continued access. “micro” just means small.
I think a Micro-SaaS business is possibly the most powerful lifestyle business model out there right now. 

### Why Would You Want a Micro-SaaS Business?
- Owning a Craft: see the fruits of your labors directly delivered. 
- Location Independence
- Time Leverage: The Magic of Recurring Revenue. SaaS can be a business that not only yields money, but starts to give you back your time.
- Building a Financial Launchpad: a Micro-SaaS business could fund you while you spend six month writing a novel or trying to make it big in the acting or music business or starting a big risky ambitious project.

## 2. What Makes a Good Micro-SaaS Idea?

failure and trial and error seem to be essential parts of the process

### The Meat Grinder
It is far more important that you develop a fast and effective way to reject business ideas than finding ways to come up with new ideas. [more here](https://tylertringas.com/business-ideas-meat-grinder/)  

### What Makes a Good Micro-SaaS Idea
- **Be 5x better than customers currently pay**: (1) your potential customers should already be spending money on the pain point your product solves. (2) you must be 5x cheaper or 5x better
- **Other players in the field**: do not follow the Silicon Valley “Zero To One” theory of creating something completely and totally new. The best scenario is finding consultants who serve the market inefficiently and expensively or customers currently suffering with horribly out-dated software. 
- **A defined group that needs your product**: This one is so critical. Avoid theoretically be used by anybody but in reality get used by nobody. Built for a defined audience so you can narrow the marketing effort and focus the product features. Think about how easy is it to actually find this target market. Consider whether you actually like interacting with the target market.
- **Have at least one channel for the first 25 and 250 customers**: get the first 25 customers for free. Think about whether these customers congregate around any particular places, directories, locations, websites.
- **Line of sight to a Minimum Viable Product that you can build**: build your MVP in a month only on weekends. You have to build in resiliency for the inevitably high likelihood that your idea actually still sucks. Build and launch fast.
- **Do you have founder/product fit**: discards ideas if they are not right fit for you

### Tactical Suggestions
- **Focus on Automation**
- **Sell to growing markets**: Make sure your total addressable market is going in the right direction.
- **Small online businesses are the sweet spot**: Freelancers or individuals can move quickly because you only have to deal with one customer

## 3. Finding Micro-SaaS Ideas
[on October 28, 2016](https://tylertringas.com/finding-micro-saas-business-ideas/)  

- **Scratch your own itch**: examples like Basecamp, Baremetrics. If you live an interesting or unique life, you will generate new and unique itches to scratch. If something about your life is really unique, then you can use scratch your own itch in that.
- **Niche versions of existing SaaS**: Looking at generalized products like Salesforce, Quickbooks, Basecamp, Freshbooks, Shopify and WordPress can be a good source of ideas for niche SaaS products. Even something as simple a building a simple CRM with data fields and workflows pre-built for a particular industry could be enough of a UX improvement to sell well. Salesforce for wedding photographers. Freshbooks for dentists. Play around with combinations until something passes the Meat Grinder.
- **Repeatable freelance and consulting work**: if you see a specific type of job that businesses are paying contractors to do over and over again from scratch, there may be an opportunity to build a SaaS solution. The best way to sniff out these kinds of opportunities is to actually become a consultant in a particular field and really learn what customers need.
- **Automate manual tasks**: 
- **Build upon growing platforms**: Stripe, Zapier

## 4. From Idea to Minimum Viable Product
on November 29, 2016

Once you get an idea that looks worth doing, you should carve out time to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as soon as possible. 

> work will expand or contract to fill the time allotted to it. If you give yourself an unlimited time horizon to launch a product you’ll likely never finish it

### Shipping a Minimum Viable Product
- **Build first or Pre-launch?**: Pre-launch(build email list) delays getting paying customers. Recommendation: massively pare down the scope of the MVP and just launch it fast.
- **What I mean by “MVP”**: do the job it purports to do.

### Building an MVP: Don’ts
most important thing, it will help keep the scope pared back.
- **Only build for new users**: skip account info, reset password, change login details, etc.
- **Go very light on branding**: do not hire someone to make you a logo, build fancy landing page, spend hours in CSS
- **Other common features that you can skip**: plans and pricing options. FRee tier(freemium). Multipayment. Multi users per account.
- **Leave out everything that you can do manually** 
- **Avoid the faux professionalism**: custom email address, fancy help desk apps, your phone number

### Building an MVP: Do’s
- **Use (and pay for) existing services**: Re-inventing the wheel is the enemy of the MVP
- **Separate your app and your landing page**
- **Do ask for credit cards upfront**: avoid free plan. At this stage you are still maximizing for information and feedback. The cost structure of freemium is risky
- **Use a single price point**: start between $9-15/month and raised it as the features were ironed out.
- **Admin Login: The one bit of code your app must have**: 

### Conclusion
Shipping a first version of the product is the biggest hurdle in the entire journey to a profitable software business.
Use this chapter to pare back an idea to it’s essence, schedule the time and ship it.
