## Building a Side Project Without Quitting Your Day Job

Side Projects: 
- Grow, Improve, and Surprise
- Increase Creativity

### Find the Time: Seizing “Leftover Minutes”
### Find the Need: Delivering Extreme Value
### Find the Fun: Imbuing Your Project with Passion
> The only way a side project will work is if people give themselves permission to think simple, to change their minds, to fail — basically, to not take them too seriously.
> When you treat something like it’s stupid, you have fun with it, you don’t put too much structure around it. You can enjoy different types of success.

So make it something that you’re into, that your really feelin’. Because, for the time being, the enjoyment and satisfaction that you get out of your project will be your only reward.

> A side project is a Labor of Love. You provide the ‘Labor’. And you provide the ‘Love’.
> So when you spend time on it, it is because you really want to. That keeps you coming back and pushing it on.

### Find the Peace: Relaxing With Imperfection
The rest of your life will likely be about meeting goals, hitting targets, and living up to expectations.

This part of your life isn’t. It’s your time to play, tinker, try things out, and wander down paths that don’t have a clear destination.

Wanting to get somewhere in as little time as possible is the surest way to kill off inspiration of any kind.

The best way to approach a side project is as an experiment, rather than something with a clear-cut goal.

> Experiments don’t ‘fail’ — they simply prove or disprove a hypothesis. So focus on the task at hand. Not the end result.

So go in without expectations and see what happens.
Something always does.

### The Big Takeaway
Don’t be scared to invest time and effort into something that truly makes you tick. It won’t distract you or tire you out; it will energize you.

Worst case scenario, you sate your curiosity.
Best case scenario, you discover your life’s work.
But either way, don’t worry too much.
After all, it’s only a side project.

## How I bootstrapped my side project into a $20k/mo lifestyle business

750 Words is a site that I built on a whim in 2009, and it's still going strong.

The whole thing keeps running because the idea is simple and writing every day is an extremely rewarding habit on its own, and grows entirely through word of mouth.

I think about the 20 other projects I've built that never went anywhere, and how glad I am that I didn't build each one of them with the expectations that it might scale to where 750 is today.

I think it's important to build something valuable before you try to make a living off of it. Starting with a free site, moving to donations, and eventually to a subscription model was the right order for us to do this in.

Same goes with the business model. I think it's important to build something valuable before you try to make a living off of it.
I'd like to make the site free again for people who can't afford it because the real goal is to help people make their lives better in a sustainable way rather than building a giant profitable business.

I'm a big fan of **intentional unoptimization** (Don’t let data drive you. Use it as a fallible indicator of progress towards the ineffable quality of a meaningful impact.). The most important things to optimize can't be measured, and trying to do so could have easily killed this project in a hundred different ways.

> Advice: Always start by working your way back to your north star—what change do you want to bring to yourself and the world?
> Then, try to take a few steps towards that north star that you think are valuable to the world, and do them really well. Then, try to make it sustainable so you can keep doing that.
