## Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting
[link](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-9813f617b3)  
The biggest tragedy for any founder isn't failure. It's becoming trapped inside a business that you don't actually like.

### What do you want for your life?
No matter what you want in life, starting a business is a powerful way to help you get it. But you have to know what you want first.

### Getting to Know Yourself
This should be your first step as a founder. Before you come up with an idea, before you find a partner, before you do anything, take the time to examine who you are.


## Goal Setting: A Scientific Guide to Setting and Achieving Goals
[link](https://jamesclear.com/goal-setting)  

### What is Goal Setting?
Rather than considering what kind of success we want, we should ask, “What kind of pain do I want?”. The real challenge is not determining if you want the result, but if you are willing to accept the sacrifices required to achieve your goal.
Everybody wants a gold medal. Few people want to train like an Olympian.

If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a million dollar business. Your system is your sales and marketing process.

Goals are useful for setting the direction. Systems are great for actually making progress.

### How to Set Goals You’ll Actually Follow
1. **Ruthlessly Eliminate Your Goals**: your goals are competing with one another for your time and attention. Focus on one goal at a time. What we really need is not bigger goals, but better focus. Check strategies in the link
2. **Stack Your Goals**: After/Before [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. You are 2x to 3x more likely to stick to your goals if you make a specific plan for when, where, and how you will perform the behavior.
3. **Set an Upper Bound**: zone of long-term growth between laziness and burnout. You want to push hard enough to make progress, but not so much that it is unsustainable.  “I want to make at least 10 sales calls today, but not more than 20.”

### How to Achieve Your Goals Consistently
You need to align your environment with your ambitions if you wish to make progress for the long-run. It's very hard to stick with positive habits in a negative environment.
Some strategies to design better default decisions
- Simplicity: When in doubt, eliminate options.
- Visual Cues: visually nudges your actions in the right direction.
- Opt-Out vs. Opt-In: Opt-In by default

### How to Measure Your Goals
One of the most motivating things we can experience is evidence of our progress. This is why measurement is so critical for effective goal setting. The things we measure are the things we improve.

The trick is to realize that counting, measuring, and tracking is not about the result. Measure to discover, to find out, to understand. Measure to see if you are showing up. Measure to see if you're actually spending time on the things that are important to you.

## How to Get and Stay Motivated
### Motivation: What It Is and How It Works
Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Once a task has begun, it is easier to continue moving it forward.

### How to Get Motivated and Take Action
- Schedule Your Motivation: If you waste resources trying to decide when or where to work, you’ll impede your capacity to do the work. Professionals set a schedule and stick to it. Amateurs wait until they feel inspired or motivated.
- How to Get Motivated (Even When You Don't Feel Like It): build rituals.
- How to Make Motivation a Habit: Reminder-rutine-reward

### How to Stay Motivated for the Long-Run
- Use Goldilocks Rule: humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
- How to Reach Peak Motivation:  you not only need to work on challenges at the right degree of difficulty, but also measure your immediate progress. 
- What to Do When Motivation Fades: Consider every thought you have as a suggestion, not an order. Discomfort Is Temporary. You Will Never Regret Good Work Once It is Done

Sometimes, the simple act of showing up and having the courage to do the work, even in an average manner, is a victory worth celebrating.
Life is a constant balance between giving into the ease of distraction or overcoming the pain of discipline.

## Why a Lifestyle Business Beats a Startup
[link](https://www.indiehackers.com/@znq/why-a-lifestyle-business-beats-a-startup-44c7c6fafe)  

Many people dream of doing what they enjoy every day, and making a good living from it. But only a small percentage believe this is actually possible. After all, how can you have fun and work profitably at the same time, right?

The secret lies in the type of business you create. Instead of launching a startup and growing a major corporation, a lifestyle business will give you the opportunity to optimize your life for happiness.

### Benefits of a Lifestyle Business
- Startups require a lot of money and an intense time investment to succeed and maybe to find that the business isn’t for you. In Lifestyle Business you remain in full control
- Running a lifestyle business certainly doesn’t mean you’re going to end up being poor; it’s all about priorities.
- At Mobile Jazz we focus on small, but continuous success stories.
- When you build a lifestyle business, your only goal will be to ensure the business is profitable enough to sustain the salaries of yourself and your team. You don't worry about growth and scale to world domination.
- You Don’t Have to Deal With Bureaucracy
- You’ve Got The Freedom to Change Your Mind at Any Time
- To make any startup succeed, you need to be totally focused on your business objectives towards the goal of making money and ultimately returning it to your investors.

## How to Find an Idea  
[How To Come Up With Good Business Ideas](https://www.indiehackers.com/article/how-to-come-up-with-good-business-ideas-4b4bfc0980)

### “Notice” ideas, don’t “think some up”
most successful startups almost always come from the founders observing something in their daily life.
A good place to start is trying to notice problems at the company you work for. Could the internal processes be improved? Are customers dissatisfied with something?
As well as utilizing your personal experiences, listen to your friends and family. 

### Seek new experiences & be patient
Moving to another country is one way to stimulate ideas.
Change your mindset. If you focus on noticing problems and pondering whether they could be solved, ideas should surface.

### Solve a problem that actually exists
### Find a group that cares enough about the problem
You need to discover whether the problem is sufficiently important and urgent to enough people.
If you can find a group of people who urgently want your product even when it’s still a work in progress, you’re probably on the right track.

### Leverage your personal experience
> “Only build something you really want to use yourself. There’s got to be one thing you are completely desperate for and no matter where you look you can’t find it. Nobody has invented it yet. So, there you go — you invent it”.

### Differentiate
You need a USP (Unique Selling Proposition). A product does not need to be unique to be successful. It simply needs to deliver enough value for people to be willing to buy it.

You’ll have a far better chance of making money if you focus on problems that companies are already addressing. This approach removes the risk of picking an insignificant problem.

### Personal fit
Do you have the skills and resources to turn your idea into a profitable business? If you don’t have them, can you learn them or acquire them without too much difficulty?

Whether you enjoy running a business will depend on whether you suit being an entrepreneur, not whether it’s related to your interests.

Boring ideas attract less attention, so there will be a higher chance of finding gaps in the market if you stop limiting your thinking to things you’re passionate about.

What matters more than your passions is what lifestyle you want to have.  If you want a lifestyle business, focus on an idea that you can execute on your own, then use technology to automate processes.

### Tight targeting makes things easier
Targeting a niche will enable you to tailor your message to people with a specific need.
> The narrower you get, the easier it is to connect with your audience, the easier it is to stand out.

### How much risk are you comfortable with?
If you pick an idea that can be brought to life with little time and money, you can start it as a side-project that you work on during your free time. This will also reduce stress as you won’t need to worry about the project failing. 
Whilst in general you’ll want to minimize risk, there’s a trade-off here as simple products can be copied more easily than those which require significant time and capital.

### Customer lifetime value vs customer acquisition costs
You may have a phenomenal product. But it means nothing if you can’t gain customers at a cost that makes sense.

### Review
you don’t need to be a creative genius. You simply need to be curious and observe when problems crop up. When you do find an idea, make sure it solves a pressing problem and think carefully about whether it’s a good fit for you.

## Do a Tiny Product First
[post link](https://stackingthebricks.com/when-should-you-start-a-saas/)  

DON’T START WITH A SAAS. Do a tiny product first. Something that doesn’t require server maintenance and security updates. A product that won’t ruin anyone’s life if you take days off.

### Software Warnings
- takes a long time to build and ship, you can run out of energy, time, motivation or money
- will demand skills you don’t have (security, backups, credit card processsing)
- you’ll be trying to do all that while learning to market, persuade, sell, and provide support
- is slow to sell
- complex business to run
- more expensive business to start
- more time consuming business to run

To create really great software is a task of epic proportions. It solves a horribly painful problem for the customer. The tricky part isn’t the technical stuff… it’s the customer stuff. 

Switching apps is risky for the customer. Your Little Twist just isn’t worth it. That’s why so many SaaS apps fail: They’re just not worth it.
That’s why you should start with an easy win.

Creating and shipping and selling a tiny product will help you gain the skills you need to successfully design and build software. It’ll build your reputation and trust with your audience. It’ll bring customers to you, to talk to you, who will reveal other problems they have.


## Start By Finding an Audience
[post link](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-a-market-to-build-a-saas/)  
A bootstrapped business works best when it starts out in a niche. Most companies will do really well by just staying there. That initial audience is one of the most important things to carefully select when you start a business.

### Have we found a painful problem?
Not all solutions will have an addressable market. People are willing to pay for some things, and they won’t even consider spending money on others.
They will spend money on their most critical problem. The closer you are to that one core issue customers are having with their job or activity, the more likely you are to capture a large part of that market with your solution.

### Is the audience large enough?
Your audience will have to be big enough to sustain your business. It will likely also have to support competitors, as any successful business will attract competition.
It boils down to doing the research and asking subject matter experts in the field about the current size and the growth trajectory. 

### Is the audience small enough?
At least, in the beginning, you should have a clearly defined niche. 
The smaller your audience, the more it has built-in network effects.

### Can they pay? Will they pay?
In the currently underserved market there won’t be much competition, but people are not used to paying for solutions. 

If you have found a painful problem, a niche audience that is both small and big enough for your business, and made sure they are willing to pay for your solution, you have found your audience. You can go and build out your product and marketing strategies for that market now.

If your market has adjacent product opportunities, that will give you a chance to think about future products you can sell. Knowing if you need to focus more on sales or on marketing is very important. 

### What are good markets for bootstrapped SaaS?
Small businesses and freelancers are great audiences for a bootstrapped SaaS
Underserved markets are a great place to start a company.

### What are bad markets for bootstrapped SaaS?
Enterprise markets. Monopoly markets with just a few big players will severely limit your options. 

### When markets turn
Good markets turn to bad markets all of the time by competitors saturation, technological changes, deterioration.
Opportunities often happens in the wake of a technological or structural change. The internet made the online education market explode.

Whatever market you choose for your business, make sure you select it with confidence and the numbers to back it up. Making the correct choice is vital to the success of your business. Choose wisely.
