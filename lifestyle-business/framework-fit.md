- How The Four Fits Work Together

The difference between the $100M+ companies, and those that struggle are the ones that are able to make four pieces in a puzzle fit: Market Product Fit, Product Channel Fit, Channel Model Fit, Model Market Fit. 
1. You need to find four fits to grow to $100M+ company in a venture-backed time frame.
2. Each of these fits influence each other, so you can’t think about them in isolation.
3. The fits are always evolving/changing/breaking.

### Searching For Market Product Fit The Right Way
There are four key `market hypotheses` elements:
- Category. What category of products does the customer put you in?
- Who. Who is the target audience within the category? There are always multiple personas within a single category, so this breaks it down further. 
- Problems. What problems does your target audience have related to the category
- Motivations. What are the motivations behind those problems? Why are those problems important to your target audience?

The four main elements that are important to define as `product hypotheses`:
- Core Value Prop. What was the core value prop of the product? How did it tie to the core problem?
- Hook. How could the core value prop be expressed in the simplest terms?
- Time To Value. How quickly could we get the target audience to experience value.
- Stickiness. How and why will customers stick around? What are the natural retention mechanisms of the product?

### The Reality Of Searching For Market Product Fit
It happens over multiple cycles of iteration. You start with a market, build an initial version of the product, look at who actually gets value from the product, then redefine the market and redefine the product: market hypotheses -> product hypotheses -> Evaluate & start again

Market Product Fit is not binary. It’s also not a single point in time.
There are two primary ways that the market changes for a startup. 
1. EXPANDING MARKET DEFINITION
2. THE MARKET EVOLVES

### The Key Points
- Start with the market (problem), then the product (solution). Not the other way around. 
- Define your market hypothesis using Category, Who, Problems, Motivations with most of your work going into Problems/Motivations. 
- Define your product hypothesis using Core Value Prop, Hook, Time To Value, Stickiness.
- Think of Market Product fit as a cycle. 
- Understand that Market Product fit is not binary. Instead, it’s a spectrum of weak to strong.
- To understand if you have Market Product Fit, combine the qualitative, quantitative and intuitive indicators.
