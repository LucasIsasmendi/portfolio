# Intro
If you're brainstorming startup ideas: It's important you learn growth hacking before deciding which idea to work on.

Growth hacking is simply data-driven revenue maximization.

Growth marketing differs from traditional marketing in that growth primarily focuses on **clearly measurable** and **directly profitable** marketing initiatives.
It works through continual optimization of every step in the customer's journey.
- **Customer acquisition** gets people to your site.
- **Product development** offers something people want.
- **Retention** keep customers coming back.
- **Experimentation** is how you iterate on all three.

## Growth hacking skills
- **Creative** when brainstorming compelling text and imagery for marketing assets.
- **Reflective** when assessing what has been learned from creative experiments.
- **Resourceful** when scaling those experiments: channels, A/B tests.

Before you hire a brand marketer, hire another product manager to make your product so enjoyable that people can't stop talking about it.

## The growth funnel
It's the journey a customer takes through your advertising and product experience: `Acquisition → Conversion → Engagement → Revenue → Referral`

### I. Acquisition
An acquisition "channel" is a place you source potential customers from. Paid or Unpaid

### II. Conversion
When visitors are intrigued by what you're offering some of them "convert" into registered users or paying customers.
You'll learn conversion optimization through Landing Pages, A/B Testing, and Ads.

### III. Engagement
educated users are more likely to become purchasers. Like User Onboarding.

### IV. Revenue
Your revenue per customer can be maximized through cost reduction, conversion rate optimization, pricing optimization, cross-selling other products, and retention.

### V. Referral
You need to make your product so good that customers do your selling for you.

## Growth funnel loops
if a user fails to engage with your product, you might show them new Instagram ads directed at your educational content. You can do this repeatedly until they're given the right content that finally motivates them to the next step.
If you can trigger the Repurchase Loop repeatedly, you may have a subscription business.

## Succeeding at acquisition
Why is paid difficult to make work? Here's the criteria that determine success:
- **Profit margins**: How much profit you earn per sale is critical. Consider how it's hard to acquire an ecommerce customer for less than $30 USD on Facebook or Instagram, which are typically the cheapest ad channels.
- **Addressable market size**: This is determined not only by how many people want your product, but are actually capable of buying your product, want your particular product, want it now, and can afford it.
- **Degree of product demand**: How badly does your addressable market want your product?
